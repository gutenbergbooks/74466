<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>


<p>The Colorado River of the West is
formed in southeastern Utah by the junction
of the Grand and Green rivers. For
hundreds of miles it flows through a series
of profound chasms, in many places from
4,000 to 6,000 feet deep, and rising nearly
vertically for a considerable distance above
the water. These cañons are from one to
fifteen miles wide at the top. The most
famous of them is the Marble-Grand
cañon (really continuous, although it goes
under two names, the Marble and the
Grand). Through this vast gorge the Colorado
drops 2,330 feet in 283 miles, the current
sometimes attaining a velocity of
twenty-five miles an hour. The river itself
varies in width from seventy-five feet to a
quarter of a mile. In the narrowest places
it has at times a depth of over 100 feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[6]</span></p>

<p>Up to 1869 practically nothing was
known of the Colorado River from its
source to where it emerges into the valley
of the Grand Wash, except what could be
observed from look-out points at the tops
of the cañons, or from the few places where
descents had been made to the bottom. It
was a river of mystery and of fear. For
long distances it was supposed to flow underground.
There was no evidence that
any human being had ever passed through
the cañons and come out alive. The Indians
who lived in the neighborhood considered
such a feat preposterous.</p>

<p>Then came a scientist and a man of
nerve, Major John Wesley Powell, who
studied the river carefully at several points
along its bank, and calmly decided to risk
his life in clearing up the mystery by navigating
the stream clear through to the
Wash.</p>

<p>The undertaking was all the more remarkable
from the fact that Powell had
only one arm. He had lost his right arm<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
in the battle of Shiloh. His plucky young
wife, to whom he had been married but a
month, was present at headquarters when
he was wounded, and promptly offered herself
as a substitute for the missing limb so
that her husband could continue in service.
She then and there enlisted, and General
Grant gave her a “perpetual pass” to follow
the army in the capacity she had
chosen. With this help Major Powell continued
in active service to the close of the
war.</p>

<p>In his student days Powell had made a
specialty of what was then called “natural
history.” When the war was over he accepted
a professorship of geology in the Illinois
Wesleyan University, and later held
a similar chair in the Illinois Normal University.
In the summer of 1867 he initiated
the practice of student field work by taking
his class to the mountains of Colorado for
geological exploration. It was on this trip
that he formed the idea of exploring the
cañons of the Colorado River of the West.<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
Having obtained funds from public institutions
of Illinois to outfit his little expedition,
he started from Green River City, above
the head of the Colorado proper, May 24,
1869, on one of the most hazardous adventures
in the history of exploration. He
emerged from the Grand Cañon on August
29, with five of the nine men he had started
with. Four had deserted on the way, and
three of these were killed by Indians.</p>

<p>Major Powell’s report on this first exploration
of the Colorado River was published
by the Smithsonian Institution in
1875. Together with the scientific data appended,
it forms a large quarto volume,
which is now out of print. The narrative
part is here republished without abridgement.</p>

<p>In 1870, Congress established a Topographical
and Geological Survey of the Colorado
River of the West, and Powell was
placed in charge of it. In 1871-1872 he
made a second descent of the river, this time
for the government. Again he came through<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
unharmed, proving his mastery of a species
of navigation so difficult that many who
have tried it in later years have perished in
those brawling waters.</p>

<p>Much of Powell’s attention was given to
American ethnology, and when a Bureau of
Ethnology was formed by the government,
he was appointed its director. In 1881 he
succeeded Clarence King as director of the
U. S. Geological Survey. Major Powell
died September 23, 1902.</p>

<br><span class="cheaderfont">THE VALLEY OF THE COLORADO</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">The Colorado River is formed by
the junction of the Grand and
Green.</p>

<p>The Grand River has its source in the
Rocky Mountains, five or six miles west of
Long’s Peak, in latitude 40° 17′ and longitude
105° 43′ approximately. A group of
little alpine lakes, that receive their waters
directly from perpetual snow-banks, discharge
into a common reservoir, known as
Grand Lake, a beautiful sheet of water. Its
quiet surface reflects towering cliffs and
crags of granite on its eastern shore; and
stately pines and firs stand on its western
margin.</p>

<p>The Green River heads near Frémont’s
Peak, in the Wind River Mountains, in latitude<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
43° 15′ and longitude 109° 45′, approximately.
This river, like the last, has its
sources in alpine lakes, fed by everlasting
snows. Thousands of these little lakes,
with deep, cold, emerald waters, are embosomed
among the crags of the Rocky Mountains.
These streams, born in the cold,
gloomy solitudes of the upper mountain region,
have a strange, eventful history as they
pass down through gorges, tumbling in cascades
and cataracts, until they reach the hot,
arid plains of the Lower Colorado, where
the waters that were so clear above empty
as turbid floods into the Gulf of California.</p>

<p>The mouth of the Colorado is in latitude
31° 53′ and longitude 115°.</p>

<p>The Green River is larger than the
Grand, and is the upper continuation of the
Colorado. Including this river, the whole
length of the stream is about two thousand
miles. The region of country drained by
the Colorado and its tributaries is about
eight hundred miles in length, and varies
from three hundred to five hundred in width,<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
containing about three hundred thousand
square miles, an area larger than all the New
England and Middle States, and Maryland
and Virginia added, or as large as Minnesota,
Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, and Missouri.</p>

<p>There are two distinct portions of the
basin of the Colorado. The lower third is
but little above the level of the sea, though
here and there ranges of mountains rise to
an altitude of from two to six thousand feet.
This part of the valley is bounded on the
north by a line of cliffs, that present a bold,
often vertical step, hundreds or thousands
of feet to the table-lands above.</p>

<p>The upper two-thirds of the basin rises
from four to eight thousand feet above the
level of the sea. This high region, on the
east, north, and west, is set with ranges of
snow-clad mountains, attaining an altitude
above the sea varying from eight to fourteen
thousand feet. All winter long, on its
mountain-crested rim, snow falls, filling the
gorges, half burying the forests, and covering<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
the crags and peaks with a mantle woven
by the winds from the waves of the sea—a
mantle of snow. When the summer-sun
comes, this snow melts, and tumbles down
the mountain-sides in millions of cascades.
Ten million cascade brooks unite to form ten
thousand torrent creeks; ten thousand torrent
creeks unite to form a hundred rivers
beset with cataracts; a hundred roaring rivers
unite to form the Colorado, which rolls,
a mad, turbid stream, into the Gulf of California.</p>

<p>Consider the action of one of these
streams: its source in the mountains, where
the snows fall; its course through the arid
plains. Now, if at the river’s flood storms
were falling on the plains, its channel would
be cut but little faster than the adjacent
country would be washed, and the general
level would thus be preserved; but, under
the conditions here mentioned, the river
deepens its bed, as there is much through
corrosion and but little lateral degradation.</p>

<p>So all the streams cut deeper and still<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
deeper until their banks are towering cliffs
of solid rock. These deep, narrow gorges
are called cañons.</p>

<p>For more than a thousand miles along its
course, the Colorado has cut for itself such
a cañon; but at some few points, where lateral
streams join it, the cañon is broken, and
narrow, transverse valleys divide it properly
into a series of cañons.</p>

<p>The Virgen, Kanab, Paria, Escalante,
Dirty Devil, San Rafael, Price, and Uinta
on the west, the Grand, Yampa, San Juan,
and Colorado Chiquito on the east, have also
cut for themselves such narrow, winding
gorges, or deep cañons. Every river entering
these has cut another cañon; every lateral
creek has cut a cañon; every brook runs
in a cañon; every rill born of a shower, and
born again of a shower, and living only during
these showers, has cut for itself a cañon;
so that the whole upper portion of the basin
of the Colorado is traversed by a labyrinth
of these deep gorges.</p>

<p>Owing to a great variety of geological<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
conditions, these cañons differ much in general
aspect. The Rio Virgen, between Long
Valley and the Mormon town of Schunesburgh,
runs through Pa-ru′-nu-weap Cañon,
often not more than twenty or thirty feet
in width, and from six hundred to one thousand
five hundred feet deep.</p>

<p>Away to the north, the Yampa empties
into the Green by a cañon that I essayed to
cross in the fall of 1868, and was baffled from
day to day until the fourth had nearly passed
before I could find my way down to the
river. But thirty miles above its mouth,
this cañon ends, and a narrow valley, with
a flood-plain, is found. Still farther up the
stream, the river comes down through another
cañon, and beyond that a narrow valley
is found, and its upper course is now
through a cañon and now a valley.</p>

<p>All these cañons are alike changeable in
their topographic characteristics.</p>

<p>The longest cañon through which the Colorado
runs is that between the mouth of the
Colorado Chiquito and the Grand Wash, a<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
distance of two hundred and seventeen and
a half miles. But this is separated from another
above, sixty-five and a half miles in
length, only by the narrow cañon-valley of
the Colorado Chiquito.</p>

<p>All the scenic features of this cañon land
are on a giant scale, strange and weird. The
streams run at depths almost inaccessible;
lashing the rocks which beset their channels;
rolling in rapids, and plunging in falls, and
making a wild music which but adds to the
gloom of the solitude.</p>

<p>The little valleys nestling along the
streams are diversified by bordering willows,
clumps of box-elder, and small groves of cottonwood.</p>

<p>Low <i lang="es">mesas</i>, dry and treeless, stretch back
from the brink of the cañon, often showing
smooth surfaces of naked, solid rock. In
some places, the country rock being composed
of marls, the surface is a bed of loose,
disintegrated material, and you walk through
it as in a bed of ashes. Often these marls
are richly colored and variegated. In other<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
places, the country rock is a loose sandstone,
the disintegration of which has left broad
stretches of drifting sand, white, golden, and
vermilion.</p>

<p>Where this sandstone is a conglomerate,
a paving of pebbles has been left, a mosaic
of many colors, polished by the drifting
sands, and glistening in the sunlight.</p>

<p>After the cañons, the most remarkable
features of the country are the long lines of
cliffs. These are bold escarpments, often
hundreds or thousands of feet in altitude,
great geographic steps, scores or hundreds
of miles in length, presenting steep faces of
rock, often quite vertical.</p>

<p>Having climbed one of these steps, you
may descend by a gentle, sometimes imperceptible,
slope to the foot of another. They
will thus present a series of terraces, the
steps of which are well-defined escarpments
of rock. The lateral extension of such a
line of cliffs is usually very irregular; sharp
salients are projected on the plains below,<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
and deep recesses are cut into the terraces
above.</p>

<p>Intermittent streams coming down the
cliffs have cut many cañons or cañon valleys,
by which the traveler may pass from the
plain below to the terrace above. By these
gigantic stairways, you may ascend to high
plateaus, covered with forests of pine and
fir.</p>

<p>The region is further diversified by short
ranges of eruptive mountains. A vast system
of fissures—huge cracks in the rocks to
the depths below—extends across the country.
From these crevices, floods of lava
have poured, covering <i lang="es">mesas</i> and table-lands
with sheets of black basalt. The expiring
energies of these volcanic agencies have
piled up huge cinder-cones, that stand along
the fissures, red, brown, and black, naked of
vegetation, and conspicuous landmarks, set,
as they are, in contrast to the bright, variegated
rocks of sedimentary origin.</p>

<p>These cañon gorges, obstructing cliffs<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
and desert wastes, have prevented the traveler
from penetrating the country, so that,
until the Colorado River Exploring Expedition
was organized, it was almost unknown.
Yet enough had been seen to foment rumor,
and many wonderful stories have been told
in the hunter’s cabin and prospector’s camp.
Stories were related of parties entering the
gorge in boats, and being carried down with
fearful velocity into whirlpools, where all
were overwhelmed in the abyss of waters;
others, of underground passages for the
great river, into which boats had passed
never to be seen again. It was currently
believed that the river was lost under the
rocks for several hundred miles. There
were other accounts of great falls, whose
roaring music could be heard on the distant
mountain-summits. There were many
stories current of parties wandering on the
brink of the cañon, vainly endeavoring to
reach the waters below, and perishing with
thirst at last in sight of the river which was
roaring its mockery into dying ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[25]</span></p>

<p>The Indians, too, have woven the mysteries
of the cañons into the myths of their
religion. Long ago, there was a great and
wise chief, who mourned the death of his
wife, and would not be comforted until Ta-vwoats,
one of the Indian gods, came to him,
and told him she was in a happier land, and
offered to take him there, that he might see
for himself, if, upon his return, he would
cease to mourn. The great chief promised.
Then Ta-vwoats made a trail through the
mountains that intervene between that beautiful
land and this, the desert home of the
poor Nu′-ma.</p>

<p>This trail was the cañon gorge of the Colorado.
Through it he led him; and, when
they had returned, the deity exacted from
the chief a promise that he would tell no one
of the joys of that land, lest, through discontent
with the circumstances of this world,
they should desire to go to heaven. Then
he rolled a river into the gorge, a mad, raging
stream, that should engulf any that might
attempt to enter thereby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[26]</span></p>

<p>More than once have I been warned by
the Indians not to enter this cañon. They
considered it disobedience to the gods and
contempt for their authority, and believed
that it would surely bring upon me their
wrath.</p>

<p>For two years previous to the exploration,
I had been making some geological studies
among the heads of the cañons leading to the
Colorado, and a desire to explore the Grand
Cañon itself grew upon me. Early in the
spring of 1869, a small party was organized
for this purpose. Boats were built in Chicago,
and transported by rail to the point
where the Union Pacific Railroad crosses
the Green River. With these we were to
descend the Green into the Colorado, and the
Colorado down to the foot of the Grand
Cañon.</p>

<br><span class="cheaderfont">FROM GREEN RIVER CITY TO FLAMING GORGE</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">May 24, 1869.—The good people of
Green River City turn out to see
us start. We raise our little flag,
push the boats from shore, and the swift current
carries us down.</p>

<p>Our boats are four in number. Three are
built of oak; stanch and firm; double-ribbed,
with double stem and stern posts,
and further strengthened by bulkheads, dividing
each into three compartments.</p>

<p>Two of these, the fore and aft, are decked,
forming water-tight cabins. It is expected
these will buoy the boats should the waves
roll over them in rough water. The little
vessels are twenty-one feet long, and, taking
out the cargoes, can be carried by four men.</p>

<p>The fourth boat is made of pine, very<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
light, but sixteen feet in length, with a sharp
cut-water, and every way built for fast rowing,
and divided into compartments as the
others.</p>

<p>We take with us rations deemed sufficient
to last ten months; for we expect, when winter
comes on and the river is filled with ice,
to lie over at some point until spring arrives;
so we take with us abundant supplies of
clothing. We have also a large quantity of
ammunition and two or three dozen traps.
For the purpose of building cabins, repairing
boats, and meeting other exigencies, we
are supplied with axes, hammers, saws, augers,
and other tools, and a quantity of nails
and screws. For scientific work, we have
two sextants, four chronometers, a number
of barometers, thermometers, compasses, and
other instruments.</p>

<p>The flour is divided into three equal parts;
the meat and all other articles of our rations
in the same way. Each of the larger boats
has an ax, hammer, saw, auger, and other
tools, so that all are loaded alike. We distribute<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
the cargoes in this way, that we may
not be entirely destitute of some important
article should any one of the boats be lost.
In the small boat, we pack a part of the scientific
instruments, three guns, and three
small bundles of clothing only. In this, I
proceed in advance, to explore the channel.</p>

<p>J. C. Sumner and William H. Dunn are
my boatmen in the <em>Emma Dean</em>;<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> then
follows <em>Kitty Clyde’s Sister</em>, manned by
W. H. Powell<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and G. Y. Bradley; next,
the <em>No Name</em>, with O. G. Howland, Seneca
Howland, and Frank Goodman; and last
comes the <em>Maid of the Cañon</em>, with W. R.
Hawkins and Andrew Hall.</p>

<p>Our boats are heavily loaded, and only
with the utmost care is it possible to float in
the rough river without shipping water.</p>

<p>A mile or two below town, we run on a
sand-bar. The men jump into the stream,
and thus lighten the vessels, so that they<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>
drift over; and on we go. In trying to
avoid a rock, an oar is broken on one of the
boats, and, thus crippled, she strikes. The
current is swift, and she is sent reeling and
rocking into the eddy. In the confusion,
two others are lost overboard and the men
seem quite discomfited, much to the amusement
of the other members of the party.</p>

<p>Catching the oars and starting again, the
boats are once more borne down the stream
until we land at a small cottonwood grove
on the bank, and camp for noon.</p>

<p>During the afternoon, we run down to a
point where the river sweeps the foot of an
overhanging cliff, and here we camp for the
night. The sun is yet two hours high, so
I climb the cliffs, and walk back among the
strangely carved rocks of the Green River
bad-lands. These are sandstones and
shales, gray and buff, red and brown, blue
and black strata in many alternations, lying
nearly horizontal, and almost without soil
and vegetation. They are very friable, and<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>
the rain and streams have carved them
into quaint shapes. Barren desolation is
stretched before me; and yet there is a beauty
in the scene. The fantastic carving, imitating
architectural forms, and suggesting
rude but weird statuary, with the bright and
varied colors of the rocks, conspire to make
a scene such as the dweller in verdure-clad
hills can scarcely appreciate.</p>

<p>Standing on a high point, I can look off
in every direction over a vast landscape, with
salient rocks and cliffs glittering in the evening
sun. Dark shadows are settling in the
valleys and gulches, and the heights are made
higher and the depths deeper by the glamour
and witchery of light and shade.</p>

<p>Away to the south, the Uinta Mountains
stretch in a long line; high peaks thrust into
the sky, and snow-fields glittering like lakes
of molten silver; and pine-forests in somber
green; and rosy clouds playing around the
borders of huge, black masses; and heights
and clouds, and mountains and snow-fields,<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>
and forests and rock-lands, are blended into
one grand view. Now the sun goes down,
and I return to camp.</p>

<p><em>May 25.</em>—We start early this morning,
and run along at a good rate until about nine
o’clock, when we are brought up on a gravelly
bar. All jump out, and help the boats
over by main strength. Then a rain comes
on, and river and clouds conspire to give us
a thorough drenching. Wet, chilled, and
tired to exhaustion, we stop at a cottonwood
grove on the bank, build a huge fire, make
a cup of coffee, and are soon refreshed and
quite merry. When the clouds “get out of
our sunshine,” we start again. A few miles
farther down, a flock of mountain-sheep are
seen on a cliff to the right. The boats are
quietly tied up, and three or four men go
after them. In the course of two or three
hours, they return. The cook has been successful
in bringing down a fat lamb. The
unsuccessful hunters taunt him with finding
it dead; but it is soon dressed, cooked, and
eaten, making a fine four o’clock dinner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[33]</span></p>

<p>“All aboard,” and down the river for another
dozen miles. On the way, we pass the
mouth of Black’s Fork, a dirty little stream
that seems somewhat swollen. Just below
its mouth, we land and camp.</p>

<p><em>May 26.</em>—To-day, we pass several curiously-shaped
buttes, standing between the
west bank of the river and the high bluffs
beyond. These buttes are outliers of the
same beds of rocks exposed on the faces of
the bluffs; thinly laminated shales and sandstones
of many colors, standing above in
vertical cliffs, and buttressed below with a
water-carved talus; some of them attain an
altitude of nearly a thousand feet above the
level of the river.</p>

<p>We glide quietly down the placid stream
past the carved cliffs of the <i lang="fr">mauvaises terres</i>,
now and then obtaining glimpses of distant
mountains. Occasionally, deer are started
from the glades among the willows; and several
wild geese, after a chase through the
water, are shot.</p>

<p>After dinner, we pass through a short,<span class="pagenum">[34]</span>
narrow cañon into a broad valley; from this,
long, lateral valleys stretch back on either
side as far as the eye can reach.</p>

<p>Two or three miles below, Henry’s Fork
enters from the right. We land a short distance
above the junction, where a <i lang="fr">cache</i> of
instruments and rations was made several
months ago, in a cave at the foot of the cliff,
a distance back from the river. Here it was
safe from the elements and wild beasts, but
not from man. Some anxiety is felt, as we
have learned that a party of Indians have
been camped near it for several weeks. Our
fears are soon allayed, for we find it all right.
Our chronometer wheels are not taken for
hair ornaments; our barometer tubes, for
beads; nor the sextant thrown into the river
as “bad medicine,” as had been predicted.</p>

<p>Taking up our <i lang="fr">cache</i>, we pass down to
the foot of the Uinta Mountains, and, in a
cold storm, go into camp.</p>

<p>The river is running to the south; the
mountains have an easterly and westerly
trend directly athwart its course, yet it glides<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
on in a quiet way as if it thought a mountain
range no formidable obstruction to its course.
It enters the range by a flaring, brilliant, red
gorge, that may be seen from the north a
score of miles away.</p>

<p>The great mass of the mountain-ridge
through which the gorge is cut is composed
of bright vermilion rocks; but they are surmounted
by broad bands of mottled buff and
gray, and these bands come down with a gentle
curve to the water’s edge on the nearer
slope of the mountain.</p>

<p>This is the head of the first cañon we are
about to explore—an introductory one to
a series made by the river through this range.
We name it Flaming Gorge. The cliffs or
walls we find, on measurement, to be about
one thousand two hundred feet high.</p>

<p><em>May 27.</em>—To-day it rains, and we employ
the time in repairing one of our barometers,
which was broken on the way from New
York. A new tube has to be put in; that is,
a long glass tube has to be filled with mercury
four or five inches at a time, and each<span class="pagenum">[36]</span>
installment boiled over a spirit-lamp. It
is a delicate task to do this without breaking
the glass; but we have success, and are ready
to measure the mountains once more.</p>

<p><em>May 28.</em>—To-day we go to the summit of
the cliff on the left and take observations for
altitude, and are variously employed in topographic
and geological work.</p>

<p><em>May 29.</em>—This morning, Bradley and I
cross the river, and climb more than a thousand
feet to a point where we can see the
stream sweeping in a long, beautiful curve
through the gorge below. Turning and
looking to the west, we can see the valley of
Henry’s Fork, through which, for many
miles, the little river flows in a tortuous channel.
Cottonwood groves are planted here
and there along its course, and between them
are stretches of grass land. The narrow
mountain valley is inclosed on either side by
sloping walls of naked rock of many bright
colors. To the south of the valley are the
Uintas, and the peaks of the Wasatch Mountains
can be faintly seen in the far west. To<span class="pagenum">[37]</span>
the north, desert plains, dotted here and there
with curiously carved hills and buttes, extend
to the limit of vision.</p>

<p>For many years, this valley has been the
home of a number of mountaineers, who
were originally hunters and trappers, living
with the Indians. Most of them have one
or more Indian wives. They no longer
roam with the nomadic tribes in pursuit of
buckskin or beaver, but have accumulated
herds of cattle and horses, and consider themselves
quite well-to-do. Some of them have
built cabins; others still live in lodges.</p>

<p>John Baker is one of the most famous of
these men; and, from our point of view, we
can see his lodge three or four miles up the
river.</p>

<p>The distance from Green River City to
Flaming Gorge is sixty-two miles. The
river runs between bluffs, in some places
standing so close to each other that no flood-plain
is seen. At such a point, the river
might properly be said to run through a
cañon. The bad-lands on either side are interrupted<span class="pagenum">[38]</span>
here and there by patches of
<em>Artemesia</em>, or sage-brush. Where there is
a flood-plain along either side of the river,
a few cottonwoods may be seen.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III
<br><span class="cheaderfont">FROM FLAMING GORGE TO THE GATE OF LODORE</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">You must not think of a mountain-range
as a line of peaks standing
on a plain, but as a broad platform
many miles wide, from which mountains
have been carved by the waters. You
must conceive, too, that this plateau is cut
by gulches and cañons in many directions,
and that beautiful valleys are scattered about
at different altitudes. The first series of
cañons we are about to explore constitutes a
river channel through such a range of mountains.
The cañon is cut nearly half-way
through the range, then turns to the east,
and is cut along the central line, or axis,
gradually crossing it to the south. Keeping
this direction for more than fifty miles,<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>
it then turns abruptly to a southwest course,
and goes diagonally through the southern
slope of the range.</p>

<p>This much we knew before entering, as
we made a partial exploration of the region
last fall, climbing many of its peaks, and in
a few places reaching the brink of the cañon
walls, and looking over the precipices, many
hundreds of feet high, to the water below.</p>

<p>Here and there the walls are broken by
lateral cañons, the channels of little streams
entering the river; through two or three of
these, we found our way down to the Green
in early winter, and walked along the low
water-beach at the foot of the cliffs for several
miles. Where the river has this general
easterly direction, the western part only
has cut for itself a cañon, while the eastern
has formed a broad valley, called, in honor
of an old-time trapper, Brown’s Park, and
long known as a favorite winter resort for
mountain men and Indians.</p>

<p><em>May 30.</em>—This morning we are ready to
enter the mysterious cañon, and start with<span class="pagenum">[41]</span>
some anxiety. The old mountaineers tell us
that it cannot be run; the Indians say, “Water
heap catch ’em,” but all are eager for the
trial, and off we go.</p>

<p>Entering Flaming Gorge, we quickly run
through it on a swift current, and emerge
into a little park. Half a mile below, the
river wheels sharply to the left, and we
turn into another cañon cut into the mountain.
We enter the narrow passage. On
either side, the walls rapidly increase in
altitude. On the left are overhanging
ledges and cliffs five hundred—a thousand—fifteen
hundred feet high.</p>

<p>On the right, the rocks are broken and
ragged, and the water fills the channel from
cliff to cliff. Now the river turns abruptly
around a point to the right, and the waters
plunge swiftly down among great rocks; and
here we have our first experience with cañon
rapids. I stand up on the deck of my boat
to seek a way among the wave beaten rocks.
All untried as we are with such waters, the
moments are filled with intense anxiety.<span class="pagenum">[42]</span>
Soon our boats reach the swift current; a
stroke or two, now on this side, now on that,
and we thread the narrow passage with exhilarating
velocity, mounting the high waves,
whose foaming crests dash over us, and
plunging into the troughs, until we reach
the quiet water below; and then comes a feeling
of great relief. Our first rapid is run.
Another mile, and we come into the valley
again.</p>

<p>Let me explain this cañon. Where the
river turns to the left above, it takes a course
directly into the mountain, penetrating to
its very heart, then wheels back upon itself,
and runs out into the valley from which it
started only half a mile below the point at
which it entered; so the cañon is in the form
of an elongated letter U, with the apex in
the center of the mountain. We name it
Horseshoe Cañon.</p>

<p>Soon we leave the valley, and enter another
short cañon, very narrow at first, but
widening below as the cañon walls increase
in height. Here we discover the mouth of<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>
a beautiful little creek, coming down through
its narrow water worn cleft. Just at its entrance
there is a park of two or three hundred
acres, walled on every side by almost
vertical cliffs, hundreds of feet in altitude,
with three gateways through the walls—one
up, another down the river, and a third passage
through which the creek comes in. The
river is broad, deep, and quiet, and its waters
mirror towering rocks.</p>

<p>Kingfishers are playing about the
streams, and so we adopt as names Kingfisher
Creek, Kingfisher Park, and Kingfisher
Cañon. At night, we camp at the foot
of this cañon.</p>

<p>Our general course this day has been south,
but here the river turns to the east around
a point which is rounded to the shape of a
dome, and on its sides little cells have been
carved by the action of the water; and in
these pits, which cover the face of the dome,
hundreds of swallows have built their nests.
As they flit about the cliffs, they look like
swarms of bees, giving to the whole the appearance<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>
of a colossal beehive of the old time
form, and so we name it Beehive Point.</p>

<p>The opposite wall is a vast amphitheater,
rising in a succession of terraces to a height
of 1,200 or 1,500 feet. Each step is built
of red sandstone, with a face of naked, red
rock, and a glacis clothed with verdure. So
the amphitheater seems banded red and
green, and the evening sun is playing with
roseate flashes on the rocks, with shimmering
green on the cedars’ spray, and iridescent
gleams on the dancing waves. The landscape
revels in the sunshine.</p>

<p><em>May 31.</em>—We start down another cañon,
and reach rapids made dangerous by high
rocks lying in the channel; so we run ashore,
and let our boats down with lines. In the
afternoon we come to more dangerous rapids,
and stop to examine them. I find we
must do the same work again, but, being
on the wrong side of the river to obtain a
foothold, must first cross over—no very easy
matter in such a current, with rapids and
rocks below. We take the pioneer boat<span class="pagenum">[45]</span>
<em>Emma Dean</em> over, and unload her on the
bank; then she returns and takes another
load. Running back and forth, she soon has
half our cargo over; then one of the larger
boats is manned and taken across, but carried
down almost to the rocks in spite of
hard rowing. The other boats follow and
make the landing, and we go into camp for
the night.</p>

<p>At the foot of the cliff on this side, there
is a long slope covered with pines; under
these we make our beds, and soon after sunset
are seeking rest and sleep. The cliffs on
either side are of red sandstone, and stretch
up toward the heavens 2,500 feet. On this
side, the long, pine clad slope is surmounted
by perpendicular cliffs, with pines on their
summits. The wall on the other side is bare
rock from the water’s edge up 2,000 feet,
then slopes back, giving footing to pines and
cedars.</p>

<p>As the twilight deepens, the rocks grow
dark and somber; the threatening roar of
the water is loud and constant, and I lie<span class="pagenum">[46]</span>
awake with thoughts of the morrow and the
cañons to come, interrupted now and then
by characteristics of the scenery that attract
my attention. And here I make a discovery.
On looking at the mountain directly
in front, the steepness of the slope is greatly
exaggerated, while the distance to its summit
and its true altitude are correspondingly
diminished. I have heretofore found that
to properly judge of the slope of a mountain
side, you must see it in profile. In coming
down the river this afternoon, I observed
the slope of a particular part of the wall,
and made an estimate of its altitude. While
at supper, I noticed the same cliff from a
position facing it, and it seemed steeper, but
not half as high. Now lying on my side and
looking at it, the true proportions appear.
This seems a wonder, and I rise up to take
a view of it standing. It is the same cliff
as at supper time. Lying down again, it
is the cliff as seen in profile, with a long slope
and distant summit. Musing on this, I forget
“the morrow and the cañons to come.”<span class="pagenum">[47]</span>
I find a way to estimate the altitude and
slope of an inclination as I can judge of
distance along the horizon. The reason is
simple. A reference to the stereoscope will
suggest it. The distance between the eyes
forms a base-line for optical triangulation.</p>

<p><em>June 1.</em>—To-day we have an exciting
ride. The river rolls down the cañon at a
wonderful rate, and, with no rocks in the
way, we make almost railroad speed. Here
and there the water rushes into a narrow
gorge; the rocks on the side roll it into the
center in great waves, and the boats go leaping
and bounding over these like things of
life. They remind me of scenes witnessed
in Middle Park; herds of startled deer
bounding through forests beset with fallen
timber. I mention the resemblance to some
of the hunters, and so striking is it that it
comes to be a common expression, “See the
black-tails jumping the logs.” At times the
waves break and roll over the boats, which
necessitates much bailing, and obliges us to
stop occasionally for that purpose. At one<span class="pagenum">[48]</span>
time, we run twelve miles an hour, stoppages
included.</p>

<p>Last spring, I had a conversation with
an old Indian named Pa′-ri-ats, who told me
about one of his tribe attempting to run
this cañon. “The rocks,” he said, holding
his hands above his head, his arms vertical,
and looking between them to the heavens,
“the rocks h-e-a-p, h-e-a-p high; the water
go h-oo-woogh, h-oo-woogh; water-pony
(boat) h-e-a-p buck; water catch ’em; no
see ’em Injun any more! no see ’em squaw
any more! no see ’em pappoose any more!”</p>

<p>Those who have seen these wild Indian
ponies rearing alternately before and behind,
or “bucking,” as it is called in the vernacular,
will appreciate his description.</p>

<p>At last we come to calm water, and a
threatening roar is heard in the distance.
Slowly approaching the point whence the
sound issues, we come near to falls, and tie
up just above them on the left. Here we
will be compelled to make a portage; so we
unload the boats, and fasten a long line to<span class="pagenum">[49]</span>
the bow, and another to the stern, of the
smaller one, and moor her close to the brink
of the fall. Then the bow-line is taken below,
and made fast; the stern-line is held
by five or six men, and the boat let down
as long as they can hold her against the
rushing waters; then, letting go one end of
the line, it runs through the ring; the boat
leaps over the fall, and is caught by the lower
rope.</p>

<p>Now we rest for the night.</p>

<p><em>June 2.</em>—This morning we make a trail
among the rocks, transport the cargoes to a
point below the falls, let the remaining boats
over, and are ready to start before noon.</p>

<p>On a high rock by which the trail passes
we find the inscription: “Ashley 18-5.”
The third figure is obscure—some of the
party reading it 1835, some 1855.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>James Baker, an old time mountaineer,
once told me about a party of men starting<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>
down the river, and Ashley was named as
one. The story runs that the boat was
swamped, and some of the party drowned
in one of the cañons below. The word
“Ashley” is a warning to us, and we resolve
on great caution.</p>

<p>Ashley Falls is the name we give to the
cataract.</p>

<p>The river is very narrow; the right wall
vertical for two or three hundred feet, the
left towering to a great height, with a vast
pile of broken rocks lying between the foot
of the cliff and the water. Some of the
rocks broken down from the ledge above
have tumbled into the channel and caused
this fall. One great cubical block, thirty
or forty feet high, stands in the middle of
the stream, and the waters, parting to either
side, plunge down about twelve feet, and are
broken again by the smaller rocks into a
rapid below. Immediately below the falls,
the water occupies the entire channel, there
being no talus at the foot of the cliffs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[51]</span></p>

<p>We embark, and run down a short distance,
where we find a landing-place for dinner.</p>

<p>On the waves again all the afternoon.
Near the lower end of this cañon, to which
we have given the name Red Cañon, is a
little park, where streams come down from
distant mountain summits, and enter the
river on either side; and here we camp for
the night under two stately pines.</p>

<p><em>June 3.</em>—This morning we spread our rations,
clothes, &amp;c., on the ground to dry, and
several of the party go out for a hunt. I
take a walk of five or six miles up to a pine
grove park, its grassy carpet bedecked with
crimson, velvet flowers, set in groups on the
stems of pear shaped cactus plants; patches
of painted cups are seen here and there, with
yellow blossoms protruding through scarlet
bracts; little blue-eyed flowers are peeping
through the grass; and the air is filled with
fragrance from the white blossoms of a
<i lang="la">Spiræa</i>. A mountain brook runs through<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
the midst, ponded below by beaver dams.
It is a quiet place for retirement from the
raging waters of the cañon.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the course of
the river, from Flaming Gorge to Beehive
Point, is in a southerly direction, and at right
angles to the Uinta Mountains, and cuts
into the range until it reaches a point within
five miles of the crest, where it turns to the
east, and pursues a course not quite parallel
to the trend of the range, but crosses the
axis slowly in a direction a little south of
east. Thus there is a triangular tract between
the river and the axis of the mountain,
with its acute angle extending eastward.
I climb a mountain overlooking this
country. To the east, the peaks are not
very high, and already most of the snow has
melted; but little patches lie here and there
under the lee of ledges of rock. To the west,
the peaks grow higher and the snow fields
larger. Between the brink of the cañon and
the foot of these peaks, there is a high bench.
A number of creeks have their sources in<span class="pagenum">[53]</span>
the snow banks to the south, and run north
into the cañon, tumbling down from 3,000
to 5,000 feet in a distance of five or six miles.
Along their upper courses, they run through
grassy valleys; but, as they approach Red
Cañon, they rapidly disappear under the
general surface of the country, and emerge
into the cañon below in deep, dark gorges
of their own. Each of these short lateral
cañons is marked by a succession of cascades
and a wild confusion of rocks and trees and
fallen timber and thick undergrowth.</p>

<p>The little valleys above are beautiful
parks; between the parks are stately pine
forests, half hiding ledges of red sandstone.
Mule-deer and elk abound; grizzly bears, too,
are abundant; wild cats, wolverines, and
mountain lions are here at home. The forest
aisles are filled with the music of birds,
and the parks are decked with flowers.
Noisy brooks meander through them; ledges
of moss-covered rocks are seen; and gleaming
in the distance are the snow fields, and
the mountain tops are away in the clouds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[54]</span></p>

<p><em>June 4.</em>—We start early and run through
to Brown’s Park. Half way down the valley,
a spur of a red mountain stretches across
the river, which cuts a cañon through it.
Here the walls are comparatively low, but
vertical. A vast number of swallows have
built their <i lang="es">adobe</i> houses on the face of the
cliffs, on either side of the river. The waters
are deep and quiet, but the swallows are
swift and noisy enough, sweeping by in their
curved paths through the air, or chattering
from the rocks. The young birds stretch
their little heads on naked necks through the
doorways of their mud houses, clamoring for
food. They are a noisy people.</p>

<p>We call this Swallow Cañon.</p>

<p>Still down the river we glide, until an early
hour in the afternoon, when we go into camp
under a giant cottonwood, standing on the
right bank, a little way back from the stream.
The party had succeeded in killing a fine lot
of wild ducks, and during the afternoon a
mess of fish is taken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[55]</span></p>

<p><em>June 5.</em>—With one of the men, I climb
a mountain, off on the right. A long spur,
with broken ledges of rocks, puts down to
the river; and along its course, or up the
“hog-back,” as it is called, I make the ascent.
Dunn, who is climbing to the same point, is
coming up the gulch. Two hours’ hard
work has brought us to the summit. These
mountains are all verdure clad; pine and cedar
forests are set on green terraces; snow
clad mountains are seen in the distance, to the
west; the plains of the upper Breen stretch
out before us, to the north, until they are lost
in the blue heavens; but half of the river cleft
range intervenes, and the river itself is at
our feet.</p>

<p>This half range, beyond the river, is composed
of long ridges, nearly parallel with
the valley. On the farther ridge, to the
north, four creeks have their sources. These
cut through the intervening ridges, one of
which is much higher than that on which
they head, by cañon gorges; then they run,<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>
with gentle curves, across the valley, their
banks set with willows, box-elders, and cottonwood
groves.</p>

<p>To the east, we look up the valley of the
Vermilion, through which Frémont found
his path on his way to the great parks of
Colorado.</p>

<p>The reading of the barometer taken, we
start down in company, and reach camp tired
and hungry, which does not abate one bit our
enthusiasm, as we tell of the day’s work,
with its glory of landscape.</p>

<p><em>June 6.</em>—At daybreak, I am awakened
by a chorus of birds. It seems as if all the
feathered songsters of the region have come
to the old tree. Several species of warblers,
woodpeckers, and flickers above, meadowlarks
in the grass, and wild geese in the river.
I recline on my elbow, and watch a lark near
by, and then awaken my bed fellow, to listen
to my Jenny Lind. A morning concert for
me; none of your “<i lang="fr">matinées</i>.”</p>

<p>Our cook has been an ox-driver, or “bullwhacker,”
on the plains, in one of those long<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>
trains now no longer seen, and he hasn’t
forgotten his old ways. In the midst of the
concert, his voice breaks in: “Roll out! roll
out! bulls in the corral! chain up the gaps!
Roll out! roll out! roll out!” And this is our
breakfast bell.</p>

<p>To-day we pass through the park, and
camp at the head of another cañon.</p>

<p><em>June 7.</em>—To-day, two or three of us climb
to the summit of the cliff, on the left, and
find its altitude, above camp, to be 2,086
feet. The rocks are split with fissures, deep
and narrow, sometimes a hundred feet, or
more, to the bottom. Lofty pines find root
in the fissures that are filled with loose earth
and decayed vegetation. On a rock we find
a pool of clear, cold water, caught from yesterday
evening’s shower. After a good
drink, we walk out to the brink of the cañon,
and look down to the water below. I can
do this now, but it has taken several years
of mountain climbing to cool my nerves, so
that I can sit, with my feet over the edge,
and calmly look down a precipice 2,000 feet.<span class="pagenum">[58]</span>
And yet I cannot look on and see another
do the same. I must either bid him come
away, or turn my head.</p>

<p>The cañon walls are buttressed on a grand
scale, with deep alcoves intervening; columned
crags crown the cliffs, and the river
is rolling below.</p>

<p>When we return to camp, at noon, the
sun shines in splendor on vermilion walls,
shaded into green and gray, where the rocks
are lichened over; the river fills the channel
from wall to wall, and the cañon opens, like
a beautiful portal, to a region of glory.</p>

<p>This evening, as I write, the sun is going
down, and the shadows are settling in the
cañon. The vermilion gleams and roseate
hues, blending with the green and gray tints,
are slowly changing to somber brown above,
and black shadows are creeping over them
below; and now it is a dark portal to a region
of gloom—the gateway through which we
are to enter on our voyage of exploration to-morrow.
What shall we find?</p>

<p>The distance from Flaming Gorge to<span class="pagenum">[59]</span>
Beehive Point is nine and two-thirds miles.
Besides, passing through the gorge, the river
runs through Horseshoe and Kingfisher
Cañons, separated by short valleys. The
highest point on the walls, at Flaming
Gorge, is 1,300 feet above the river. The
east wall, at the apex of Horseshoe Cañon,
is about 1,600 feet above the water’s edge,
and, from this point, the walls slope both to
the head and foot of the cañon.</p>

<p>Kingfisher Cañon, starting at the water’s
edge above, steadily increases in altitude to
1,200 feet at the foot.</p>

<p>Red Cañon is twenty-five and two-thirds
miles long, and the highest walls are about
2,500 feet.</p>

<p>Brown’s Park is a valley, bounded on
either side by a mountain range, really an
expansion of the cañon. The river, through
the park, is thirty-five and a half miles long,
but passes through two short cañons, on its
way, where spurs, from the mountains on the
south, are thrust across its course.</p>

</div>


<p class="dropcap">June 8.—We enter the cañon, and,
until noon, find a succession of rapids,
over which our boats have to be
taken.</p>

<p>Here I must explain our method of proceeding
at such places. The <em>Emma Dean</em>
goes in advance; the other boats follow, in
obedience to signals. When we approach
a rapid, or what, on other rivers, would often
be called a fall, I stand on deck to examine
it, while the oarsmen back water, and we
drift on as slowly as possible. If I can see
a clear chute between the rocks, away we
go; but if the channel is beset entirely across,
we signal the other boats, pull to land, and
I walk along the shore for closer examination.
If this reveals no clear channel, hard<span class="pagenum">[61]</span>
work begins. We drop the boats to the
very head of the dangerous place, and let
them over by lines, or make a portage, frequently
carrying both boats and cargoes over
the rocks, or, perhaps, only the cargoes, if
it is safe to let the boats down.</p>

<p>The waves caused by such falls in a river
differ much from the waves of the sea. The
water of an ocean wave merely rises and
falls; the form only passes on, and form
chases form unceasingly. A body floating
on such waves merely rises and sinks—does
not progress unless impelled by wind or some
other power. But here, the water of the
wave passes on, while the form remains.
The waters plunge down ten or twenty feet,
to the foot of a fall; spring up again in a
great wave; then down and up, in a series
of billows, that gradually disappear in the
more quiet waters below; but these waves
are always there, and you can stand above
and count them.</p>

<p>A boat riding such, leaps and plunges
along with great velocity. Now, the difficulty<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
in riding over these falls, when the
rocks are out of the way, is in the first wave
at the foot. This will sometimes gather for
a moment, heaping up higher and higher,
until it breaks back. If the boat strikes it
the instant after it breaks, she cuts through,
and the mad breaker dashes its spray over
the boat, and would wash us overboard did
we not cling tight. If the boat, in going
over the falls, chances to get caught in some
side current, and is turned from its course,
so as to strike the wave “broadside on,” and
the wave breaks at the same instant, the boat
is capsized. Still, we must cling to her, for,
the water tight compartments acting as
buoys, she cannot sink; and so we go,
dragged through the waves, until still waters
are reached. We then right the boat, and
climb aboard. We have several such experiences
to-day.</p>

<p>At night, we camp on the right bank, on
a little shelving rock, between the river and
the foot of the cliff; and with night comes
gloom into these great depths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[63]</span></p>

<p>After supper, we sit by our camp fire,
made of drift wood caught by the rocks, and
tell stories of wild life; for the men have
seen such in the mountains, or on the plains,
and on the battle fields of the South. It is
late before we spread our blankets on the
beach.</p>

<p>Lying down, we look up through the
cañon, and see that only a little of the blue
heaven appears overhead—a crescent of blue
sky, with two or three constellations peering
down upon us.</p>

<p>I do not sleep for some time, as the excitement
of the day has not worn off. Soon
I see a bright star, that appears to rest on
the very verge of the cliff overhead to the
east. Slowly it seems to float from its resting
place on the rock over the cañon. At
first, it appears like a jewel set on the brink
of the cliff; but, as it moves out from the
rock, I almost wonder that it does not fall.
In fact, it does seem to descend in a gentle
curve, as though the bright sky in which the
stars are set was spread across the cañon,<span class="pagenum">[64]</span>
resting on either wall, and swayed down by
its own weight. The stars appear to be in
the cañon. I soon discover that it is the
bright star Vega, so it occurs to me to designate
this part of the wall as the “Cliff of the
Harp.”</p>

<p><em>June 9.</em>—One of the party suggests that
we call this the Cañon of Lodore, and the
name is adopted. Very slowly we make our
way, often climbing on the rocks at the edge
of the water for a few hundred yards, to
examine the channel before running it.</p>

<p>During the afternoon, we come to a place
where it is necessary to make a portage. The
little boat is landed, and the others are signaled
to come up.</p>

<p>When these rapids or broken falls occur,
usually the channel is suddenly narrowed by
rocks which have been tumbled from the
cliffs or have been washed in by lateral
streams. Immediately above the narrow,
rocky channel, on one or both sides, there is
often a bay of quiet water, in which we can
land with ease. Sometimes the water descends<span class="pagenum">[65]</span>
with a smooth, unruffled surface,
from the broad, quiet spread above, into the
narrow, angry channel below, by a semicircular
sag. Great care must be taken not
to pass over the brink into this deceptive
pit, but above it we can row with safety. I
walk along the bank to examine the ground,
leaving one of my men with a flag to guide
the other boats to the landing-place. I soon
see one of the boats make shore all right and
feel no more concern; but a minute after,
I hear a shout, and looking around, see one
of the boats shooting down the center of the
sag. It is the <em>No Name</em>, with Captain Howland,
his brother, and Goodman. I feel
that its going over is inevitable, and run to
save the third boat. A minute more, and
she turns the point and heads for the shore.
Then I turn down stream again, and scramble
along to look for the boat that has gone
over. The first fall is not great, only ten
or twelve feet, and we often run such; but
below, the river tumbles down again for forty
or fifty feet, in a channel filled with dangerous<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>
rocks that break the waves into whirlpools
and beat them into foam. I pass
around a great crag just in time to see the
boat strike a rock, and, rebounding from the
shock, careen and fill the open compartment
with water. Two of the men lose their oars;
she swings around, and is carried down at
a rapid rate, broadside on, for a few yards,
and strikes amidships on another rock with
great force, is broken quite in two, and the
men are thrown into the river; the larger
part of the boat floating buoyantly, they
soon seize it, and down the river they drift,
past the rocks for a few hundred yards to a
second rapid, filled with huge boulders, where
the boat strikes again, and is dashed to pieces,
and the men and fragments are soon carried
beyond my sight. Running along, I turn
a bend, and see a man’s head above the water,
washed about in a whirlpool below a great
rock.</p>

<p>It is Frank Goodman, clinging to it with
a grip upon which life depends. Coming
opposite, I see Howland trying to go to his<span class="pagenum">[67]</span>
aid from an island on which he has been
washed. Soon, he comes near enough to
reach Frank with a pole, which he extends
toward him. The latter lets go the rock,
grasps the pole, and is pulled ashore. Seneca
Howland is washed farther down the
island, and is caught by some rocks, and,
though somewhat bruised, manages to get
ashore in safety. This seems a long time,
as I tell it, but it is quickly done.</p>

<p>And now the three men are on an island,
with a swift, dangerous river on either side,
and a fall below. The <em>Emma Dean</em> is soon
brought down, and Sumner, starting above
as far as possible, pushes out. Right skillfully
he plies the oars, and a few strokes set
him on the island at the proper point. Then
they all pull the boat up stream, as far as
they are able, until they stand in water up
to their necks. One sits on a rock, and holds
the boat until the others are ready to pull,
then gives the boat a push, clings to it with
his hands, and climbs in as they pull for
mainland, which they reach in safety. We<span class="pagenum">[68]</span>
are as glad to shake hands with them as
though they had been on a voyage around
the world, and wrecked on a distant coast.</p>

<p>Down the river half a mile we find that
the after cabin of the wrecked boat, with a
part of the bottom, ragged and splintered,
has floated against a rock, and stranded.
There are valuable articles in the cabin; but,
on examination, we determine that life
should not be risked to save them. Of
course, the cargo of rations, instruments, and
clothing is gone.</p>

<p>We return to the boats, and make camp
for the night. No sleep comes to me in all
those dark hours. The rations, instruments,
and clothing have been divided among the
boats, anticipating such an accident as this;
and we started with duplicates of everything
that was deemed necessary to success. But,
in the distribution, there was one exception
to this precaution, and the barometers were
all placed in one boat, and they are lost.
There is a possibility that they are in the
cabin lodged against the rock, for that is<span class="pagenum">[69]</span>
where they were kept. But, then, how to
reach them! The river is rising. Will they
be there to-morrow? Can I go out to Salt
Lake City, and obtain barometers from New
York?</p>

<p><em>June 10.</em>—I have determined to get the
barometers from the wreck, if they are there.
After breakfast, while the men make the
portage, I go down again for another examination.
There the cabin lies, only carried
fifty or sixty feet farther on.</p>

<p>Carefully looking over the ground, I am
satisfied that it can be reached with safety,
and return to tell the men my conclusion.
Sumner and Dunn volunteer to take the little
boat and make the attempt. They start,
reach it, and out come the barometers; and
now the boys set up a shout, and I join them,
pleased that they should be as glad to save
the instruments as myself. When the boat
lands on our side, I find that the only things
saved from the wreck were the barometers,
a package of thermometers, and a three gallon
keg of whisky, which is what the men<span class="pagenum">[70]</span>
were shouting about. They had taken it
aboard, unknown to me, and now I am glad
they did, for they think it will do them good,
as they are drenched every day by the melting
snow, which runs down the summits of
the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>Now we come back to our work at the
portage. We find that it is necessary to
carry our rations over the rocks for nearly
a mile, and let our boats down with lines, except
at a few points, where they also must be
carried.</p>

<p>Between the river and the eastern wall
of the cañon there is an immense talus of
broken rocks. These have tumbled down
from the cliffs above, and constitute a vast
pile of huge angular fragments. On these
we build a path for a quarter of a mile, to a
small sand beach covered with drift-wood,
through which we clear a way for several
hundred yards, then continue the trail on
over another pile of rocks, nearly half a mile
farther down, to a little bay. The greater
part of the day is spent in this work. Then<span class="pagenum">[71]</span>
we carry our cargoes down to the beach and
camp for the night.</p>

<p>While the men are building the camp fire,
we discover an iron bake oven, several tin
plates, a part of a boat, and many other
fragments, which denote that this is the place
where Ashley’s party was wrecked.</p>

<p><em>June 11.</em>—This day is spent in carrying
our rations down to the bay—no small task
to climb over the rocks with sacks of flour
or bacon. We carry them by stages of
about 500 yards each, and when night comes,
and the last sack is on the beach, we are tired,
bruised, and glad to sleep.</p>

<p><em>June 12.</em>—To-day we take the boats down
to the bay. While at this work, we discover
three sacks of flour from the wrecked boat,
that have lodged in the rocks. We carry
them above high-water mark, and leave them,
as our cargoes are already too heavy for the
three remaining boats. We also find two
or three oars, which we place with them.</p>

<p>As Ashley and his party were wrecked
here, and as we have lost one of our boats at<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
the same place, we adopt the name Disaster
Falls for the scene of so much peril and loss.</p>

<p>Though some of his companions were
drowned, Ashley and one other survived the
wreck, climbed the cañon wall, and found
their way across the Wasatch Mountains to
Salt Lake City, living chiefly on berries, as
they wandered through an unknown and difficult
country. When they arrived at Salt
Lake, they were almost destitute of clothing,
and nearly starved. The Mormon people
gave them food and clothing, and employed
them to work on the foundation of the
Temple, until they had earned sufficient to
enable them to leave the country. Of their
subsequent history, I have no knowledge.
It is possible they returned to the scene of
the disaster, as a little creek entering the
river below is known as Ashley’s Creek, and
it is reported that he built a cabin and
trapped on this river for one or two winters;
but this may have been before the disaster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[73]</span></p>

<p><em>June 13.</em>—Still rocks, rapids, and portages.</p>

<p>We camp to-night at the foot of the left
wall on a little patch of flood-plain covered
with a dense growth of box-elders, stopping
early in order to spread the clothing and
rations to dry. Everything is wet and
spoiling.</p>

<p><em>June 14.</em>—Howland and I climb the wall,
on the west side of the cañon, to an altitude
of 2,000 feet. Standing above, and looking
to the west, we discover a large park,
five or six miles wide and twenty or thirty
long. The cliff we have climbed forms a
wall between the cañon and the park, for
it is 800 feet, down the western side, to the
valley. A creek comes winding down, 1,200
feet above the river, and, entering the intervening
wall by a cañon, it plunges down,
more than a thousand feet, by a broken cascade,
into the river below.</p>

<p><em>June 15.</em>—To-day, while we make another
portage, a peak, standing on the east<span class="pagenum">[74]</span>
wall, is climbed by two of the men, and
found to be 2,700 feet above the river. On
the east side of the cañon, a vast amphitheater
has been cut, with massive buttresses,
and deep, dark alcoves, in which grow beautiful
mosses and delicate ferns, while springs
burst out from the further recesses, and
wind, in silver threads, over floors of sand
rock. Here we have three falls in close
succession. At the first, the water is compressed
into a very narrow channel, against
the right-hand cliff, and falls fifteen feet
in ten yards; at the second, we have a broad
sheet of water, tumbling down twenty feet
over a group of rocks that thrust their dark
heads through the foaming waters. The
third is a broken fall, or short, abrupt rapid,
where the water makes a descent of more
than twenty feet among huge, fallen fragments
of the cliff. We name the group
Triplet Falls.</p>

<p>We make a portage around the first; past
the second and third we let down with lines.</p>

<p>During the afternoon, Dunn and Howland,<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
having returned from their climb, we
run down, three-quarters of a mile, on quiet
water, and land at the head of another fall.
On examination, we find that there is an
abrupt plunge of a few feet, and then the
river tumbles, for half a mile, with a descent
of a hundred feet, in a channel beset with
great numbers of huge boulders. This
stretch of the river is named Hell’s Half-Mile.</p>

<p>The remaining portion of the day is occupied
in making a trail among the rocks to
the foot of the rapid.</p>

<p><em>June 16.</em>—Our first work this morning
is to carry our cargoes to the foot of the
falls. Then we commence letting down the
boats. We take two of them down in
safety, but not without great difficulty; for,
where such a vast body of water, rolling
down an inclined plane, is broken into eddies
and cross currents by rocks projecting
from the cliffs and piles of boulders in the
channel, it requires excessive labor and much
care to prevent their being dashed against<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>
the rocks or breaking away. Sometimes we
are compelled to hold the boat against a
rock, above a chute, until a second line, attached
to the stem, is carried to some point
below, and, when all is ready, the first line
is detached, and the boat given to the current,
when she shoots down, and the men below
swing her into some eddy.</p>

<p>At such a place, we are letting down the
last boat, and, as she is set free, a wave
turns her broadside down the stream, with
the stem, to which the line is attached, from
shore, and a little up. They haul on the
line to bring the boat in, but the power of
the current, striking obliquely against her,
shoots her out into the middle of the river.
The men have their hands burned with the
friction of the passing line; the boat breaks
away, and speeds, with great velocity, down
the stream.</p>

<p>The <em>Maid of the Cañon</em> is lost, so it
seems; but she drifts some distance, and
swings into an eddy, in which she spins<span class="pagenum">[77]</span>
about, until we arrive with the small boat,
and rescue her.</p>

<p>Soon we are on our way again, and stop
at the mouth of a little brook, on the right,
for a late dinner. This brook comes down
from the distant mountains, in a deep side
cañon. We set out to explore it, but are
soon cut off from farther progress up the
gorge by a high rock, over which the brook
glides in a smooth sheet. The rock is not
quite vertical, and the water does not plunge
over in a fall.</p>

<p>Then we climb up to the left for an hour,
and are a thousand feet above the river, and
six hundred above the brook. Just before
us, the cañon divides, a little stream coming
down on the right, and another on the left,
and we can look away up either of these cañons,
through an ascending vista, to cliffs and
crags and towers, a mile back, and two thousand
feet overhead. To the right, a dozen
gleaming cascades are seen. Pines and firs
stand on the rocks and aspens overhang the<span class="pagenum">[78]</span>
brooks. The rocks below are red and
brown, set in deep shadows, but above, they
are buff and vermilion, and stand in the
sunshine. The light above, made more brilliant
by the bright-tinted rocks, and the
shadows below more gloomy by the somber
hues of the brown walls, increase the apparent
depths of the cañons, and it seems a
long way up to the world of sunshine and
open sky, and a long way down to the bottom
of the cañon glooms. Never before
have I received such an impression of the
vast heights of these cañon walls; not even
at the Cliff of the Harp, where the very
heavens seemed to rest on their summits.</p>

<p>We sit on some overhanging rocks, and
enjoy the scene for a time, listening to the
music of falling waters away up the cañons.
We name this Rippling Brook.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon we make a short
run to the mouth of another little creek,
coming down from the left into an alcove
filled with luxuriant vegetation. Here
camp is made with a group of cedars on one<span class="pagenum">[79]</span>
side and a dense mass of box-elders and dead
willows on the other.</p>

<p>I go up to explore the alcove. While
away a whirlwind comes, scattering the fire
among the dead willows and cedar-spray,
and soon there is a conflagration. The
men rush for the boats, leaving all they cannot
readily seize at the moment, and even
then they have their clothing burned and
hair singed, and Bradley has his ears
scorched. The cook fills his arms with the
mess-kit, and, jumping into a boat, stumbles
and falls, and away go our cooking
utensils into the river. Our plates are gone;
our spoons are gone; our knives and forks
are gone. “Water catch ’em; h-e-a-p catch
’em.”</p>

<p>When on the boats, the men are compelled
to cut loose, as the flames, running out on
the overhanging willows, are scorching
them. Loose on the stream, they must go
down, for the water is too swift to make
headway against it. Just below is a rapid,
filled with rocks. On they shoot, no channel<span class="pagenum">[80]</span>
explored, no signal to guide them. Just
at this juncture I chance to see them, but
have not yet discovered the fire, and the
strange movements of the men fill me with
astonishment. Down the rocks I clamber,
and run to the bank. When I arrive, they
have landed. Then we all go back to the
late camp to see if anything left behind can
be saved. Some of the clothing and bedding
taken out of the boats is found, also
a few tin cups, basins, and a camp kettle,
and this is all the mess kit we now have.
Yet we do just as well as ever.</p>

<p><em>June 17.</em>—We run down to the mouth
of Yampa River. This has been a chapter
of disasters and toils, notwithstanding
which the Cañon of Lodore was not devoid
of scenic interest, even beyond the power
of pen to tell. The roar of its waters was
heard unceasingly from the hour we entered
it until we landed here. No quiet in all
that time. But its walls and cliffs, its peaks
and crags, its amphitheaters and alcoves, tell<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>
a story of beauty and grandeur that I hear
yet—and shall hear.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The Cañon of Lodore is twenty and three-quarter
miles in length. It starts abruptly
at what we have called the Gate of Lodore,
with walls nearly two thousand feet high, and
they are never lower than this until we reach
Alcove Brook, about three miles above the
foot. They are very irregular, standing in
vertical or overhanging cliffs in places, terraced
in others, or receding in steep slopes,
and are broken by many side gulches
and cañons. The highest point on the wall
is at Dunn’s Cliff, near Triplet Falls,
where the rocks reach an altitude of 2,700
feet, but the peaks a little way back rise
nearly a thousand feet higher. Yellow
pines, nut pines, firs, and cedars stand in
extensive forests on the Uinta Mountains,
and, clinging to the rocks and growing in
the crevices, come down the walls to the
water’s edge from Flaming Gorge to Echo<span class="pagenum">[82]</span>
Park. The red sandstones are lichened
over; delicate mosses grow in the moist
places, and ferns festoon the walls.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[83]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V
<br><span class="cheaderfont">FROM ECHO PARK TO THE MOUTH OF THE UINTA RIVER</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">The Yampa enters the Green from
the east. At a point opposite its
mouth, the Green runs to the south,
at the foot of a rock, about seven hundred
feet high and a mile long, and then
turns sharply around it to the right, and
runs back in a northerly course, parallel to
its former direction, for nearly another mile,
thus having the opposite sides of a long,
narrow rock for its bank. The tongue of
rock so formed is a peninsular precipice,
with a mural escarpment along its whole
course on the east, but broken down at
places on the west.</p>

<p>On the east side of the river, opposite the
rock, and below the Yampa, there is a little<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
park, just large enough for a farm, already
fenced with high walls of gray homogeneous
<a id="BRef_84" href="#Ref_84">sandstone</a>. There are three river entrances
to this park: one down the Yampa;
one below, by coming up the Green; and
another down the Green. There is also a
land entrance down a lateral cañon. Elsewhere
the park is inaccessible. Through this
land-entrance by the side cañon there is a
trail made by Indian hunters, who come
down here in certain seasons to kill mountain
sheep.</p>

<p>Great hollow domes are seen in the eastern
side of the rock, against which the Green
sweeps; willows border the river; clumps of
box-elder are seen; and a few cottonwoods
stand at the lower end. Standing opposite
the rock, our words are repeated with startling
clearness, but in a soft, mellow tone,
that transforms them into magical music.
Scarcely can you believe it is the echo of
your own voice. In some places two or
three echoes come back; in other places they
repeat themselves, passing back and forth<span class="pagenum">[85]</span>
across the river between this rock and the
eastern wall.</p>

<p>To hear these repeated echoes well you
must shout. Some of the party aver that
ten or twelve repetitions can be heard. To
me, they seem to rapidly diminish and merge
by multiplicity, like telegraph poles on an
outstretched plain. I have observed the
same phenomenon once before in the cliffs
near Long’s Peak, and am pleased to meet
with it again.</p>

<p>During the afternoon, Bradley and I
climb some cliffs to the north. Mountain
sheep are seen above us, and they stand out
on the rocks, and eye us intently, not seeming
to move. Their color is much like that
of the gray sandstone beneath them, and,
immovable as they are, they appear like
carved forms. Now a fine ram beats the
rock with his front foot, and, wheeling
around, they all bound away together, leaping
over rocks and chasms, and climbing
walls where no man can follow, and this
with an ease and gracefulness most wonderful.<span class="pagenum">[86]</span>
At night we return to our camp, under
the box-elders, by the river side. Here
we are to spend two or three days, making
a series of astronomic observations for latitude
and longitude.</p>

<p><em>June 18.</em>—We have named the long peninsular
rock on the other side Echo Rock.
Desiring to climb it, Bradley and I take
the little boat and pull up stream as far as
possible, for it cannot be climbed directly
opposite. We land on a talus of rocks at
the upper end, to reach a place where it
seems practicable to make the ascent; but
we must go still farther up the river. So
we scramble along, until we reach a place
where the river sweeps against the wall.
Here we find a shelf, along which we can
pass, and now are ready for the climb.</p>

<p>We start up a gulch; then pass to the
left, on a bench, along the wall; then up
again, over broken rocks; then we reach
more benches, along which we walk, until
we find more broken rocks and crevices, by
which we climb still up, until we have ascended<span class="pagenum">[87]</span>
six or eight hundred feet; then we
are met by a sheer precipice.</p>

<p>Looking about, we find a place where it
seems possible to climb. I go ahead; Bradley
hands the barometer to me, and follows.
So we proceed, stage by stage, until we are
nearly to the summit. Here, by making a
spring, I gain a foothold in a little crevice,
and grasp an angle of the rock overhead.
I find I can get up no farther, and cannot
step back, for I dare not let go with my
hand, and cannot reach foot-hold below
without.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> I call to Bradley for help. He
finds a way by which he can get to the top
of the rock over my head, but cannot reach
me. Then he looks around for some stick
or limb of a tree, but finds none. Then
he suggests that he had better help me with
the barometer case; but I fear I cannot hold
on to it. The moment is critical. Standing
on my toes, my muscles begin to tremble.
It is sixty or eighty feet to the foot
of the precipice. If I lose my hold I shall<span class="pagenum">[88]</span>
fall to the bottom, and then perhaps roll
over the bench, and tumble still farther
down the cliff. At this instant it occurs to
Bradley to take off his drawers, which he
does, and swings them down to me. I hug
close to the rock, let go with my hand, seize
the dangling legs, and, with his assistance,
I am enabled to gain the top.</p>

<p>Then we walk out on a peninsular rock,
make the necessary observations for determining
its altitude above camp, and return,
finding an easy way down.</p>

<p><em>June 19.</em>—To-day, Howland, Bradley,
and I take the <em>Emma Dean</em>, and start up
the Yampa River. The stream is much
swollen, the current swift, and we are able
to make but slow progress against it. The
cañon in this part of the course of the
Yampa is cut through light gray sandstone.
The river is very winding, and the swifter
water is usually found on the outside of the
curve, sweeping against vertical cliffs, often
a thousand feet high. In the center of
these curves, in many places, the rock above<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>
overhangs the river. On the opposite side,
the walls are broken, craggy, and sloping,
and occasionally side cañons enter. When
we have rowed until we are quite tired we
stop, and take advantage of one of these
broken places to climb out of the cañon.
When above, we can look up the Yampa for
a distance of several miles.</p>

<p>From the summit of the immediate walls
of the cañon the rocks rise gently back for a
distance of a mile or two, having the appearance
of a valley, with an irregular, rounded
sandstone floor, and in the center of the valley
a deep gorge, which is the cañon. The
rim of this valley on the north is from two
thousand five hundred to three thousand feet
above the river; on the south, it is not so
high. A number of peaks stand on this
northern rim, the highest of which has received
the name Mount Dawes.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon we descend to our
boat, and return to camp in Echo Park, gliding
down in twenty minutes on the rapid
river a distance of four or five miles, which<span class="pagenum">[90]</span>
was only made up stream by several hours’
hard rowing in the morning.</p>

<p><em>June 20.</em>—This morning two of the men
take me up the Yampa for a short distance,
and I go out to climb. Having reached the
top of the cañon, I walk over long stretches
of naked sandstone, crossing gulches now
and then, and by noon reach the summit of
Mount Dawes. From this point I can look
away to the north, and see in the dim distance
the Sweetwater and Wind River Mountains,
more than a hundred miles away. To the
northwest, the Wasatch Mountains are in
view and peaks of the Uinta. To the east,
I can see the western slopes of the Rocky
Mountains, more than a hundred and fifty
miles distant.</p>

<p>The air is singularly clear to-day; mountains
and buttes stand in sharp outline, valleys
stretch out in the perspective, and I can
look down into the deep cañon gorges and see
gleaming waters.</p>

<p>Descending, I cross a ridge near the brink
of the Cañon of Lodore, the highest point of<span class="pagenum">[91]</span>
which is nearly as high as the last mentioned
mountain.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon I stand on this elevated
point, and discover a monument that
has evidently been built by human hands. A
few plants are growing in the joints between
the rocks, and all are lichened over to a
greater or less extent, showing evidences that
the pile was built a long time ago. This line
of peaks, the eastern extension of the Uinta
Mountains, has received the name of Sierra
Escalante, in honor of a Spanish priest, who
traveled in this region of country nearly a
century ago; and, perchance, the reverend
father built this monument.</p>

<p>Now I return to the river and discharge
my gun, as a signal for the boat to come and
take me down to camp. While we have been
in the park, the men have succeeded in catching
quite a number of fish, and we have an
abundant supply. This is quite an addition
to our <i lang="fr">cuisine</i>.</p>

<p><em>June 21.</em>—We float around the long rock,
and enter another cañon. The walls are<span class="pagenum">[92]</span>
high and vertical; the cañon is narrow; and
the river fills the whole space below, so that
there is no landing-place at the foot of the
cliff. The Green is greatly increased by the
Yampa, and we now have a much larger
river. All this volume of water, confined,
as it is, in a narrow channel, and rushing with
great velocity, is set eddying and spinning in
whirlpools by projecting rocks and short
curves, and the waters waltz their way
through the cañon, making their own rippling,
rushing, roaring music. The cañon is
much narrower than any we have seen.
With difficulty we manage our boats. They
spin about from side to side, and we know
not where we are going, and find it impossible
to keep them headed down the stream.
At first, this causes us great alarm, but we
soon find there is but little danger, and that
there is a general movement of progression
down the river, to which this whirling is but
an adjunct; and it is the merry mood of the
river to dance through this deep, dark gorge;<span class="pagenum">[93]</span>
and right gaily do we join in the sport.</p>

<p>Soon our revel is interrupted by a cataract;
its roaring command is heeded by all
our power at the oars, and we pull against
the whirling current. The <em>Emma Dean</em> is
brought up against a cliff, about fifty feet
above the brink of the fall. By vigorously
plying the oars on the side opposite the wall,
as if to pull up stream, we can hold her
against the rock. The boats behind are signaled
to land where they can. The <em>Maid of
the Cañon</em> is pulled to the left wall, and, by
constant rowing, they can hold her also. The
<em>Sister</em> is run into an alcove on the right,
where an eddy is in a dance, and in this she
joins. Now my little boat is held against
the wall only by the utmost exertion, and it is
impossible to make headway against the current.
On examination, I find a horizontal
crevice in the rock, about ten feet above the
water, and a boat’s length below us, so we
let her down to that point. One of the men
clambers into the crevice, in which he can<span class="pagenum">[94]</span>
just crawl; we toss him the line, which he
makes fast in the rocks, and now our boat is
tied up. Then I follow into the crevice, and
we crawl along a distance of fifty feet, or
more, up stream, and find a broken place,
where we can climb about fifty feet higher.
Here we stand on a shelf, that passes along
down stream to a point above the falls,
where it is broken down, and a pile of rocks,
over which we can descend to the river, is
lying against the foot of the cliff.</p>

<p>It has been mentioned that one of the
boats is on the other side. I signal for the
men to pull her up alongside of the wall, but
it cannot be done; then to cross. This they
do, gaining the wall on our side just above
where the <em>Emma Dean</em> is tied.</p>

<p>The third boat is out of sight, whirling in
the eddy of a recess. Looking about, I find
another horizontal crevice, along which I
crawl to a point just over the water, where
this boat is lying, and, calling loud and long,
I finally succeed in making the crew understand
that I want them to bring the boat<span class="pagenum">[95]</span>
down, hugging the wall. This they accomplish,
by taking advantage of every crevice
and knob on the face of the cliff, so that we
have the three boats together at a point a
few yards above the falls. Now, by passing
a line up on the shelf, the boats can be let
down to the broken rocks below. This we
do, and, making a short portage, our troubles
here are over.</p>

<p>Below the falls, the cañon is wider, and
there is more or less space between the river
and the walls; but the stream, though wide,
is rapid, and rolls at a fearful rate among
the rocks. We proceed with great caution,
and run the large boats altogether by signal.</p>

<p>At night we camp at the mouth of a small
creek, which affords us a good supper of
trout. In camp, to-night, we discuss the
propriety of several different names for this
cañon. At the falls, encountered at noon,
its characteristics change suddenly. Above,
it is very narrow, and the walls are almost
vertical; below, the cañon is much wider, and<span class="pagenum">[96]</span>
more flaring; and, high up on the sides,
crags, pinnacles, and towers are seen. A
number of wild, narrow side cañons enter,
and the walls are much broken. After many
suggestions, our choice rests between two
names, Whirlpool Cañon and Craggy
Cañon, neither of which is strictly appropriate
for both parts of it; but we leave the
discussion at this point, with the understanding
that it is best, before finally deciding on
a name, to wait until we see what the cañon
is below.</p>

<p><em>June 22.</em>—Still making short portages
and letting down with lines. While we are
waiting for dinner to-day, I climb a point
that gives me a good view of the river for
two or three miles below, and I think we can
make a long run. After dinner, we start;
the large boats are to follow in fifteen minutes,
and look out for the signal to land.
Into the middle of the stream we row, and
down the rapid river we glide, only making
strokes enough with the oars to guide the
boat. What a headlong ride it is! shooting<span class="pagenum">[97]</span>
past rocks and islands! I am soon filled with
exhilaration only experienced before in riding
a fleet horse over the outstretched
prairie. One, two, three, four miles we go,
rearing and plunging with the waves, until
we wheel to the right into a beautiful park,
and land on an island, where we go into
camp.</p>

<p>An hour or two before sunset, I cross to
the mainland, and climb a point of rocks
where I can overlook the park and its surroundings.
On the east it is bounded by
a high mountain ridge. A semicircle of
naked hills bounds it on the north, west, and
south. The broad, deep river meanders
through the park, interrupted by many
wooded islands; so I name it Island Park,
and decide to call the cañon above Whirlpool
Cañon.</p>

<p><em>June 23.</em>—We remain in camp to-day to
repair our boats, which have had hard knocks,
and are leaking. Two of the men go out
with the barometer to climb the cliff at the
foot of Whirlpool Cañon and measure the<span class="pagenum">[98]</span>
walls; another goes on the mountain to hunt;
and Bradley and I spend the day among the
rocks, studying an interesting geological
fold and collecting fossils. Late in the
afternoon, the hunter returns, and brings
with him a fine, fat deer, so we give his name
to the mountain—Mount Hawkins. Just
before night we move camp to the lower end
of the park, floating down the river about
four miles.</p>

<p><em>June 24.</em>—Bradley and I start early to
climb the mountain ridge to the east; find its
summit to be nearly three thousand feet
above camp, and it has required some labor
to scale it; but on its top, what a view! There
is a long spur running out from the Uinta
Mountains toward the south, and the river
runs lengthwise through it. Coming down
Lodore and Whirlpool Cañons, we cut
through the southern slope of the Uinta
Mountains; and the lower end of this latter
cañon runs into the spur, but, instead of splitting
it the whole length, the river wheels to
the right at the foot of Whirlpool Cañon, in<span class="pagenum">[99]</span>
a great curve to the northwest, through
Island Park. At the lower end of the park,
the river turns again to the southeast, and
cuts into the mountain to its center, and then
makes a detour to the southwest, splitting
the mountain ridge for a distance of six miles
nearly to its foot, and then turns out of it to
the left. All this we can see where we stand
on the summit of Mount Hawkins, and so
we name the gorge below Split Mountain
Cañon.</p>

<p>We are standing three thousand feet
above its waters, which are troubled with billows,
and white with foam. Its walls are set
with crags and peaks, and buttressed towers,
and overhanging domes. Turning to the
right, the park is below us, with its island
groves reflected by the deep, quiet waters.
Rich meadows stretch out on either hand,
to the verge of a sloping plain, that comes
down from the distant mountains. These
plains are of almost naked rock, in strange
contrast to the meadows; blue and lilac colored
rocks, buff and pink, vermilion and<span class="pagenum">[100]</span>
brown, and all these colors clear and bright.
A dozen little creeks, dry the greater part of
the year, run down through the half circle of
exposed formations, radiating from the
island-center to the rim of the basin. Each
creek has its system of side streams, and each
side stream has its system of laterals, and,
again, these are divided, so that this outstretched
slope of rock is elaborately embossed.
Beds of different colored formations
run in parallel bands on either side.
The perspective, modified by the undulations,
gives the bands a waved appearance,
and the high colors gleam in the midday sun
with the luster of satin. We are tempted
to call this Rainbow Park. Away beyond
these beds are the Uinta and Wasatch
Mountains, with their pine forests and snow
fields and naked peaks. Now we turn to
the right, and look up Whirlpool Cañon,
a deep gorge, with a river in the bottom—a
gloomy chasm, where mad waves roar;
but, at this distance and altitude, the river
is but a rippling brook, and the chasm a<span class="pagenum">[101]</span>
narrow cleft. The top of the mountain
on which we stand is a broad, grassy table,
and a herd of deer is feeding in the distance.
Walking over to the southeast, we
look down into the valley of White River,
and beyond that see the far distant Rocky
Mountains, in mellow, perspective haze,
through which snow fields shine.</p>

<p><em>June 25.</em>—This morning, we enter Split
Mountain Cañon, sailing in through a
broad, flaring, brilliant gateway. We run
two or three rapids after they have been
carefully examined. Then we have a series
of six or eight, over which we are compelled
to pass by letting the boats down with
lines. This occupies the entire day, and we
camp at night at the mouth of a great
cave.</p>

<p>The cave is at the foot of one of these
rapids, and the waves dash in nearly to its
very end. We can pass along a little shelf
at the side until we reach the back part.
Swallows have built their nests in the ceiling,
and they wheel in, chattering and scolding<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>
at our intrusion; but their clamor is almost
drowned by the noise of the waters.
Looking out of the cave, we can see, far up
the river, a line of crags standing sentinel
on either side, and Mount Hawkins in the
distance.</p>

<p><em>June 26.</em>—The forenoon is spent in getting
our large boats over the rapids. This
afternoon, we find three falls in close succession.
We carry our rations over the
rocks, and let our boats shoot over the falls,
checking and bringing them to land with
lines in the eddies below. At three o’clock
we are all aboard again. Down the river
we are carried by the swift waters at great
speed, sheering around a rock now and then
with a timely stroke or two of the oars. At
one point, the river turns from left to right,
in a direction at right angles to the cañon,
in a long chute, and strikes the right, where
its waters are heaped up in great billows,
that tumble back in breakers. We glide
into the chute before we see the danger, and
it is too late to stop. Two or three hard<span class="pagenum">[103]</span>
strokes are given on the right, and we pause
for an instant, expecting to be dashed
against the rock. The bow of the boat
leaps high on a great wave; the rebounding
waters hurl us back, and the peril is past.
The next moment, the other boats are hurriedly
signaled to land on the left. Accomplishing
this, the men walk along the
shore, holding the boats near the bank, and
let them drift around. Starting again, we
soon debouch into a beautiful valley, and
glide down its length for ten miles, and
camp under a grand old cottonwood. This
is evidently a frequent resort for Indians.
Tent poles are lying about, and the dead
embers of late camp fires are seen. On the
plains, to the left, antelope are feeding.
Now and then a wolf is seen, and after dark
they make the air resound with their howling.</p>

<p><em>June 27.</em>—Now our way is along a gently
flowing river, beset with many islands;
groves are seen on either side, and natural
meadows, where herds of antelope are feeding.<span class="pagenum">[104]</span>
Here and there we have views of the
distant mountains on the right.</p>

<p>During the afternoon, we make a long
detour to the west, and return again, to a
point not more than half a mile from where
we started at noon, and here we camp, for
the night, under a high bluff.</p>

<p><em>June 28.</em>—To-day, the scenery on either
side of the river is much the same as that of
yesterday, except that two or three lakes
are discovered, lying in the valley to the
west. After dinner, we run but a few minutes,
when we discover the mouth of the
Uinta, a river coming in from the west. Up
the valley of this stream, about forty miles,
the reservation of the Uinta Indians is situated.
We propose to go there, and see if
we can replenish our mess kit, and, perhaps,
send letters to friends. We also desire to
establish an astronomic station here; and
hence this will be our stopping place for
several days.</p>

<p>Some years ago, Captain Berthoud surveyed
a stage route from Salt Lake City to<span class="pagenum">[105]</span>
Denver, and this is the place where he
crossed the Green River. His party was
encamped here for some time, constructing
a ferry boat and opening a road.</p>

<p>A little above the mouth of the Uinta, on
the west side of the Green, there is a lake of
several thousand acres. We carry our
boat across the divide between this and the
river, have a row on its quiet waters, and
succeed in shooting several ducks.</p>

<p><em>June 29.</em>—A mile and three quarters from
here is the junction of the White River with
the Green. The White has its source far
to the east, in the Rocky Mountains. This
morning, I cross the Green, and go over into
the valley of the White, and extend my
walk several miles along its winding way,
until, at last, I come in sight of some
strangely carved rocks, named by General
Hughes, in his journal, “Goblin City.”
Our last winter’s camp was situated a hundred
miles above the point reached to-day.
The course of the river, for much of the distance,
is through cañons; but, at some<span class="pagenum">[106]</span>
places, valleys are found. Excepting these
little valleys, the region is one of great desolation:
arid, almost treeless, bluffs, hills,
ledges of rock, and drifting sands. Along
the course of the Green, however, from the
foot of Split Mountain Cañon to a point
some distance below the mouth of the Uinta,
there are many groves of cottonwood, natural
meadows, and rich lands. This arable
belt extends some distance up the White
River, on the east, and the Uinta, on the
west, and the time must soon come when
settlers will penetrate this country, and
make homes.</p>

<p><em>June 30.</em>—We have a row up the Uinta
to-day, but are not able to make much headway
against the swift current, and hence
conclude we must walk all the way to the
agency.</p>

<p><em>July 1.</em>—Two days have been employed
in obtaining the local time, taking observations
for latitude and longitude, and making
excursions into the adjacent country.
This morning, with two of the men, I start<span class="pagenum">[107]</span>
for the Agency. It is a toilsome walk,
twenty miles of the distance being across
a sand desert. Occasionally, we have to
wade the river, crossing it back and forth.
Toward evening, we cross several beautiful
streams, which are tributaries of the Uinta,
and we pass through pine groves and meadows,
arriving just at dusk at the Reservation.
Captain Dodds, the agent, is away,
having gone to Salt Lake City, but his assistants
received us very kindly. It is
rather pleasant to see a house once more,
and some evidences of civilization, even if it
is on an Indian reservation, several days’
ride from the nearest home of the white
man.</p>

<p><em>July 2.</em>—I go, this morning, to visit
<em>Tsau′-wi-at</em>. This old chief is but the
wreck of a man, and no longer has influence.
Looking at him, you can scarcely realize
that he is a man. His skin is shrunken,
wrinkled, and dry, and seems to cover no
more than a form of bones. He is said to
be more than a hundred years old. I talk<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>
a little with him, but his conversation is incoherent,
though he seems to take pride in
showing me some medals, that must have
been given him many years ago. He has
a pipe which, he says, he has used a long
time. I offer to exchange with him, and he
seems to be glad to accept; so I add another
to my collection of pipes. His wife, “The
Bishop,” as she is called, is a very garrulous
old woman; she exerts a great influence,
and is much revered. She is the only Indian
woman I have known to occupy a place
in the council ring. She seems very much
younger than her husband, and, though
wrinkled and ugly, is still vigorous. She
has much to say to me concerning the condition
of the people, and seems very anxious
that they should learn to cultivate the soil,
own farms, and live like white men. After
talking a couple of hours with these old people,
I go to see the farms. They are situated
in a very beautiful district, where many
fine streams of water meander across alluvial
plains and meadows. These creeks<span class="pagenum">[109]</span>
have quite a fall, and it is very easy to take
their waters out above, and, with them,
overflow the lands.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that irrigation is
necessary, in this dry climate, to successful
farming. Quite a number of Indians have
each a patch of ground, of two or three
acres, on which they are raising wheat, potatoes,
turnips, pumpkins, melons, and
other vegetables. Most of the crops are
looking well, and it is rather surprising with
what pride they show us that they are able
to cultivate crops like white men. They are
still occupying lodges, and refuse to build
houses, assigning as a reason that when any
one dies in a lodge it is always abandoned,
and very often burned with all the effects
of the deceased, and when houses have been
built for them they have been treated in the
same way. With their unclean habits, a
fixed residence would doubtless be no pleasant
place. This beautiful valley has been
the home of a people of a higher grade of
civilization than the present Utes. Evidences<span class="pagenum">[110]</span>
of this are quite abundant; on our
way here yesterday we discovered, in many
places along the trail, fragments of pottery;
and wandering about the little farms to-day,
I find the foundations of ancient houses, and
mealing stones that were not used by nomadic
people, as they are too heavy to be
transported by such tribes, and are deeply
worn. The Indians, seeing that I am interested
in these matters, take pains to show
me several other places where these evidences
remain, and tell me that they know
nothing about the people who formerly
dwelt here. They further tell me that up
in the cañon the rocks are covered with pictures.</p>

<p><em>July 5.</em>—The last two days have been
spent in studying the language of the Indians,
and making collections of articles illustrating
the state of arts among them.</p>

<p>Frank Goodman informs me, this morning,
that he has concluded not to go on with
the party, saying that he has seen danger<span class="pagenum">[111]</span>
enough. It will be remembered that he
was one of the crew on the <em>No Name</em> when
she was wrecked. As our boats are rather
heavily loaded, I am content that he should
leave, although he has been a faithful man.</p>

<p>We start early on our return to the boats,
taking horses with us from the reservation,
and two Indians, who are to bring the animals
back.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Whirlpool Cañon is fourteen and a quarter
miles in length, the walls varying from
one thousand eight hundred to two thousand
four hundred feet in height. The
course of the river through Island Park is
nine miles. Split Mountain Cañon is eight
miles long. The highest crags on its walls
reach an altitude above the river of from two
thousand five hundred to two thousand
seven hundred feet. In these cañons, cedars
only are found on the walls.</p>

<p>The distance by river from the foot of
Split Mountain Cañon to the mouth of the<span class="pagenum">[112]</span>

<br><span class="cheaderfont">FROM THE MOUTH OF THE UINTA RIVER TO THE JUNCTION OF THE GRAND AND GREEN</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">July 6.—Start early this morning.
A short distance below the mouth
of the Uinta, we come to the head
of a long island. Last winter, a man
named Johnson, a hunter and Indian trader,
visited us at our camp in White River Valley.
This man has an Indian wife, and,
having no fixed home, usually travels with
one of the Ute bands. He informed me it
was his intention to plant some corn, potatoes,
and other vegetables on this island in
the spring, and, knowing that we would pass
it, invited us to stop and help ourselves, even
if he should not be there; so we land and go
out on the island. Looking about, we soon
discover his garden, but it is in a sad condition,<span class="pagenum">[114]</span>
having received no care since it was
planted. It is yet too early in the season
for corn, but Hall suggests that potato tops
are good greens, and, anxious for some
change from our salt meat fare, we gather
a quantity and take them aboard. At noon
we stop and cook our greens for dinner; but
soon, one after another of the party is taken
sick; nausea first, and then severe vomiting,
and we tumble around under the trees,
groaning with pain, and I feel a little
alarmed, lest our poisoning be severe.
Emetics are administered to those who are
willing to take them, and about the middle
of the afternoon we are all rid of the pain.
Jack Sumner records in his diary that “Potato
tops are not good greens on the sixth
day of July.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>This evening we enter another cañon, almost
imperceptibly, as the walls rise very
gently.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[115]</span></p>
<p><em>July 7.</em>—We find quiet water to-day, the
river sweeping in great and beautiful
curves, the cañon walls steadily increasing
in altitude. The escarpment formed by the
cut edges of the rock are often vertical,
sometimes terraced, and in some places the
treads of the terraces are sloping. In these
quiet curves vast amphitheaters are formed,
now in vertical rocks, now in steps.</p>

<p>The salient point of rock within the curve
is usually broken down in a steep slope, and
we stop occasionally to climb up, at such a
place, where, on looking down, we can see
the river sweeping the foot of the opposite
cliff, in a great, easy curve, with a perpendicular
or terraced wall rising from the water’s
edge many hundreds of feet. One of
these we find very symmetrical, and name
it Sumner’s Amphitheater. The cliffs are
rarely broken by the entrance of side cañons,
and we sweep around curve after curve,
with almost continuous walls, for several
miles.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon, we find the river<span class="pagenum">[116]</span>
much rougher, and come upon rapids, not
dangerous, but still demanding close attention.</p>

<p>We camp at night on the right bank, having
made to-day twenty-six miles.</p>

<p><em>July 8.</em>—This morning, Bradley and I
go out to climb, and gain an altitude of
more than two thousand feet above the river,
but still do not reach the summit of the
wall.</p>

<p>After dinner, we pass through a region of
the wildest desolation. The cañon is very
tortuous, the river very rapid, and many
lateral cañons enter on either side. These
usually have their branches, so that the region
is cut into a wilderness of gray and
brown cliffs. In several places, these lateral
cañons are only separated from each
other by narrow walls, often hundreds of
feet high, but so narrow in places that where
softer rocks are found below, they have
crumbled away, and left holes in the wall,
forming passages from one cañon into another.<span class="pagenum">[117]</span>
These we often call natural bridges;
but they were never intended to span
streams. They had better, perhaps, be
called side doors between cañon chambers.</p>

<p>Piles of broken rock lie against these
walls; crags and tower shaped peaks are
seen everywhere; and away above them,
long lines of broken cliffs, and above and
beyond the cliffs are pine forests, of which
we obtain occasional glimpses, as we look
up through a vista of rocks.</p>

<p>The walls are almost without vegetation;
a few dwarf bushes are seen here and there,
clinging to the rocks, and cedars grow from
the crevices—not like the cedars of a land
refreshed with rains, great cones bedecked
with spray, but ugly clumps, like war clubs,
beset with spines. We are minded to call
this the Cañon of Desolation.</p>

<p>The wind annoys us much to-day. The
water, rough by reason of the rapids, is made
more so by head gales. Wherever a great
face of rock has a southern exposure, the<span class="pagenum">[118]</span>
rarified air rises, and the wind rushes in below,
either up or down the cañon, or both,
causing local currents.</p>

<p>Just at sunset, we run a bad rapid, and
camp at its foot.</p>

<p><em>July 9.</em>—Our run to-day is through a
cañon, with ragged, broken walls, many lateral
gulches or cañons entering on either
side. The river is rough, and occasionally
it becomes necessary to use lines in passing
rocky places. During the afternoon, we
come to a rather open cañon valley, stretching
up toward the west, its farther end lost
in the mountains. From a point to which
we climb, we obtain a good view of its
course, until its angular walls are lost in the
vista.</p>

<p><em>July 10.</em>—Sumner, who is a fine mechanist,
is learning to take observations for time
with the sextant. To-day, he remains in
camp to practice.</p>

<p>Howland and myself determine to climb
out, and start up a lateral cañon, taking a
barometer with us, for the purpose of measuring<span class="pagenum">[119]</span>
the thickness of the strata over which
we pass. The readings of a barometer below
are recorded every half hour, and our
observations must be simultaneous. Where
the beds, which we desire to measure, are
very thick, we must climb with the utmost
speed, to reach their summits in time.
Again, where there are thinner beds, we
wait for the moment to arrive; and so, by
hard and easy stages, we make our way to
the top of the cañon wall, and reach the
plateau above about two o’clock.</p>

<p>Howland, who has his gun with him, sees
deer feeding a mile or two back, and goes
off for a hunt. I go to a peak, which seems
to be the highest one in this region, about
half a mile distant, and climb, for the purpose
of tracing the topography of the adjacent
country. From this point, a fine
view is obtained. A long plateau stretches
across the river, in an easterly and westerly
direction, the summit covered by pine forests,
with intervening elevated valleys and
gulches. The plateau itself is cut in two<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
by the cañon. Other side cañons head
away back from the river, and run down
into the Green. Besides these, deep and
abrupt cañons are seen to head back on the
plateau, and run north toward the Uinta
and White Rivers. Still other cañons head
in the valleys, and run toward the south.
The elevation of the plateau being about
eight thousand feet above the level of the
sea, brings it into a region of moisture, as
is well attested by the forests and grassy
valleys. The plateau seems to rise gradually
to the west, until it merges into the
Wasatch Mountains. On these high table
lands, elk and deer abound; and they are
favorite hunting grounds for the Ute Indians.</p>

<p>A little before sunset, Howland and I
meet again at the head of the side cañon,
and down we start. It is late, and we must
make great haste, or be caught by the darkness;
so we go, running where we can; leaping
over the ledges; letting each other down
on the loose rocks, as long as we can see.<span class="pagenum">[121]</span>
When darkness comes, we are still some distance
from camp, and a long, slow, anxious
descent we make, towards the gleaming camp
fire.</p>

<p>After supper, observations for latitude
are taken, and only two or three hours for
sleep remain, before daylight.</p>

<p><em>July 11.</em>—A short distance below camp
we run a rapid, and, in doing so, break an
oar, and then lose another, both belonging
to the <em>Emma Dean</em>. So the pioneer boat
has but two oars.</p>

<p>We see nothing of which oars can be made,
so we conclude to run on to some point,
where it seems possible to climb out to the
forests on the plateau, and there we will procure
suitable timber from which to make
new ones.</p>

<p>We soon approach another rapid. Standing
on deck, I think it can be run, and on
we go. Coming nearer, I see that at the
foot it has a short turn to the left, where the
waters pile up against the cliff. Here we
try to land, but quickly discover that, being<span class="pagenum">[122]</span>
in swift water, above the fall, we cannot
reach shore, crippled, as we are, by the loss
of two oars; so the bow of the boat is turned
down stream. We shoot by a big rock; a
reflex wave rolls over our little boat and fills
her. I see the place is dangerous, and
quickly signal to the other boats to land
where they can. This is scarcely completed
when another wave rolls our boat over, and
I am thrown some distance into the water.
I soon find that swimming is very easy, and
I cannot sink. It is only necessary to ply
strokes sufficient to keep my head out of the
water, though now and then, when a breaker
rolls over me, I close my mouth, and am carried
through it. The boat is drifting ahead
of me twenty or thirty feet, and, when the
great waves are passed, I overtake it, and
find Sumner and Dunn clinging to her. As
soon as we reach quiet water, we all swim to
one side and turn her over. In doing this,
Dunn loses his hold and goes under; when
he comes up, he is caught by Sumner and
pulled to the boat. In the meantime we<span class="pagenum">[123]</span>
have drifted down stream some distance, and
see another rapid below. How bad it may
be we cannot tell, so we swim toward shore,
pulling our boat with us, with all the vigor
possible, but are carried down much faster
than distance toward shore is gained. At
last we reach a huge pile of drift wood. Our
rolls of blankets, two guns, and a barometer
were in the open compartment of the boat,
and, when it went over, these were thrown
out. The guns and barometer are lost, but
I succeeded in catching one of the rolls of
blankets, as it drifted by, when we were
swimming to shore; the other two are lost,
and sometimes hereafter we may sleep cold.</p>

<p>A huge fire is built on the bank, our clothing
is spread to dry, and then from the drift
logs we select one from which we think oars
can be made, and the remainder of the day is
spent in sawing them out.</p>

<p><em>July 12.</em>—This morning, the new oars
are finished, and we start once more. We
pass several bad rapids, making a short portage
at one, and before noon we come to a<span class="pagenum">[124]</span>
long, bad fall, where the channel is filled with
rocks on the left, turning the waters to the
right, where they pass under an overhanging
rock. On examination, we determine to run
it, keeping as close to the left hand rocks as
safety will permit, in order to avoid the overhanging
cliff. The little boat runs over all
right; another follows, but the men are not
able to keep her near enough to the left bank,
and she is carried, by a swift chute, into great
waves to the right, where she is tossed about,
and Bradley is knocked over the side, but his
foot catching under the seat, he is dragged
along in the water, with his head down; making
great exertion, he seizes the gunwale
with his left hand, and can lift his head above
water now and then. To us who are below,
it seems impossible to keep the boat from
going under the overhanging cliff; but Powell,
for the moment, heedless of Bradley’s
mishap, pulls with all his power for half a
dozen strokes, when the danger is past; then
he seizes Bradley, and pulls him in. The<span class="pagenum">[125]</span>
men in the boat above, seeing this, land, and
she is let down by lines.</p>

<p>Just here we emerge from the Cañon of
Desolation, as we have named it, into a more
open country, which extends for a distance
of nearly a mile, when we enter another
cañon, cut through gray sandstone.</p>

<p>About three o’clock in the afternoon we
meet with a new difficulty. The river fills
the entire channel; the walls are vertical on
either side, from the water’s edge, and a bad
rapid is beset with rocks. We come to the
head of it, and land on a rock in the stream;
the little boat is let down to another rock
below, the men of the larger boat holding to
the line; the second boat is let down in the
same way, and the line of the third boat is
brought with them. Now, the third boat
pushes out from the upper rock, and, as we
have her line below, we pull in and catch her,
as she is sweeping by at the foot of the rock
on which we stand. Again the first boat is
let down stream the full length of her line,<span class="pagenum">[126]</span>
and the second boat is passed down by the
first to the extent of her line, which is held
by the men in the first boat; so she is two
lines’ length from where she started. Then
the third boat is let down past the second,
and still down, nearly to the length of her
line, so that she is fast to the second boat,
and swinging down three lines’ lengths, with
the other two boats intervening. Held in
this way, the men are able to pull her into a
cove, in the left wall, where she is made fast.
But this leaves a man on the rock above,
holding to the line of the little boat. When
all is ready, he springs from the rock, clinging
to the line with one hand, and swimming
with the other, and we pull him in as he goes
by. As the two boats, thus loosened, drift
down, the men in the cove pull us all in, as
we come opposite; then we pass around to a
point of rock below the cove, close to the
wall, land, and make a short portage over the
worst places in the rapid, and start again.</p>

<p>At night we camp on a sand beach; the
wind blows a hurricane; the drifting sand<span class="pagenum">[127]</span>
almost blinds us; and nowhere can we find
shelter. The wind continues to blow all
night; the sand sifts through our blankets,
and piles over us, until we are covered as in
a snow-drift. We are glad when morning
comes.</p>

<p><em>July 13.</em>—This morning, we have an exhilarating
ride. The river is swift, and
there are many smooth rapids. I stand on
deck, keeping careful watch ahead, and we
glide along, mile after mile, plying strokes
now on the right, and then on the left, just
sufficient to guide our boats past the rocks
into smooth water. At noon we emerge
from Gray Cañon, as we have named it, and
camp, for dinner, under a cottonwood tree,
standing on the left bank.</p>

<p>Extensive sand plains extend back from
the immediate river valley, as far as we can
see, on either side. These naked, drifting
sands gleam brilliantly in the midday sun of
July. The reflected heat from the glaring
surface produces a curious motion of the atmosphere;
little currents are generated, and<span class="pagenum">[128]</span>
the whole seems to be trembling and moving
about in many directions, or, failing to see
that the movement is in the atmosphere, it
gives the impression of an unstable land.
Plains, and hills, and cliffs, and distant
mountains seem vaguely to be floating about
in a trembling, wave rocked sea, and patches
of landscape will seem to float away, and be
lost, and then re-appear.</p>

<p>Just opposite, there are buttes, that are
outliers of cliffs to the left. Below, they are
composed of shales and marls of light blue
and slate colors; and above, the rocks are
buff and gray, and then brown. The buttes
are buttressed below, where the azure rocks
are seen, and terraced above through the
gray and brown beds. A long line of cliffs
or rock escarpments separate the table
lands, through which Gray Cañon is cut,
from the lower plain. The eye can trace
these azure beds and cliffs, on either side of
the river, in a long line, extending across its
course, until they fade away in the perspective.
These cliffs are many miles in length,<span class="pagenum">[129]</span>
and hundreds of feet high; and all these
buttes—great mountain-masses of rock—are
dancing and fading away, and re-appearing,
softly moving about, or so they
seem to the eye, as seen through the shifting
atmosphere.</p>

<p>This afternoon, our way is through a valley,
with cottonwood groves on either side.
The river is deep, broad, and quiet.</p>

<p>About two hours from noon camp, we discover
an Indian crossing, where a number of
rafts, rudely constructed of logs and bound
together by withes, are floating against the
bank. On landing, we see evidences that a
party of Indians have crossed within a very
few days. This is the place where the lamented
Gunnison crossed, in the year 1853,
when making an exploration for a railroad
route to the Pacific coast.</p>

<p>An hour later, we run a long rapid, and
stop at its foot to examine some curious
rocks, deposited by mineral springs that at
one time must have existed here, but which
are no longer flowing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[130]</span></p>

<p><em>July 14.</em>—This morning, we pass some curious
black bluffs on the right, then two or
three short cañons, and then we discover the
mouth of the San Rafael, a stream which
comes down from the distant mountains in
the west. Here we stop for an hour or two,
and take a short walk up the valley, and find
it is a frequent resort for Indians. Arrow
heads are scattered about, many of them
very beautiful. Flint chips are seen strewn
over the ground in great profusion, and the
trails are well worn.</p>

<p>Starting after dinner, we pass some beautiful
buttes on the left, many of which are
very symmetrical. They are chiefly composed
of gypsum of many hues, from light
gray to slate color; then pink, purple, and
brown beds.</p>

<p>Now, we enter another cañon. Gradually
the walls rise higher and higher as we proceed,
and the summit of the cañon is formed
of the same beds of orange colored sandstone.
Back from the brink, the hollows of
the plateau are filled with sand disintegrated<span class="pagenum">[131]</span>
from these orange beds. They are of
rich cream color, shaded into maroon, everywhere
destitute of vegetation, and drifted
into long, wave like ridges.</p>

<p>The course of the river is tortuous, and it
nearly doubles upon itself many times. The
water is quiet, and constant rowing is necessary
to make much headway. Sometimes,
there is a narrow flood plain between the
river and the wall, on one side or the other.
Where these long, gentle curves are found,
the river washes the very foot of the outer
wall. A long peninsula of willow bordered
meadow projects within the curve, and the
talus, at the foot of the cliff, is usually covered
with dwarf oaks. The orange colored
sandstone is very homogeneous in structure,
and the walls are usually vertical, though not
very high. Where the river sweeps around
a curve under a cliff, a vast hollow dome may
be seen, with many caves and deep alcoves,
that are greatly admired by the members of
the party, as we go by.</p>

<p>We camp at night on the left bank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[132]</span></p>

<p><em>July 15.</em>—Our camp is in a great bend of
the cañon. The perimeter of the curve is to
the west, and we are on the east side of the
river. Just opposite, a little stream comes
down through a narrow side cañon. We
cross, and go up to explore it. Just at its
mouth, another lateral cañon enters, in the
angle between the former and the main
cañon above. Still another enters in the
angle between the cañon below and the side
cañon first mentioned, so that three side
cañons enter at the same point. These
cañons are very tortuous, almost closed in
from view, and, seen from the opposite side
of the river, they appear like three alcoves;
and we name this Trin-Alcove Bend.</p>

<p>Going up the little stream, in the central
cove, we pass between high walls of sandstone,
and wind about in glens. Springs
gush from the rocks at the foot of the walls;
narrow passages in the rocks are threaded,
caves are entered, and many side cañons are
observed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[133]</span></p>

<p>The right cove is a narrow, winding gorge,
with overhanging walls, almost shutting out
the light.</p>

<p>The left is an amphitheater, turning
spirally up, with overhanging shelves. A
series of basins, filled with water, are seen at
different altitudes, as we pass up; huge rocks
are piled below on the right, and overhead
there is an arched ceiling. After exploring
these alcoves, we recross the river, and climb
the rounded rocks on the point of the bend.
In every direction, as far as we are able to
see, naked rocks appear. Buttes are scattered
on the landscape, here rounded into
cones, there buttressed, columned, and carved
in quaint shapes, with deep alcoves and
sunken recesses. All about us are basins,
excavated in the soft sandstones; and these
have been filled by the late rains.</p>

<p>Over the rounded rocks and water pockets
we look off on a fine stretch of river, and
beyond are naked rocks and beautiful buttes
to the Azure Cliffs, and beyond these, and<span class="pagenum">[134]</span>
above them, the Brown Cliffs, and still beyond,
mountain peaks; and clouds piled over
all.</p>

<p>On we go, after dinner, with quiet water,
still compelled to row, in order to make fair
progress. The cañon is yet very tortuous.</p>

<p>About six miles below noon camp, we go
around a great bend to the right, five miles
in length, and come back to a point within a
quarter of a mile of where we started. Then
we sweep around another great bend to the
left, making a circuit of nine miles, and come
back to the point within six hundred yards of
the beginning of the bend. In the two circuits,
we describe almost the figure 8. The
men call it a bow-knot of river; so we name
it Bow-Knot Bend. The line of the figure
is fourteen miles in length.</p>

<p>There is an exquisite charm in our ride to-day
down this beautiful cañon. It gradually
grows deeper with every mile of travel;
the walls are symmetrically curved, and
grandly arched; of a beautiful color, and reflected
in the quiet waters in many places, so<span class="pagenum">[135]</span>
as to almost deceive the eye, and suggest the
thought, to the beholder, that he is looking
into profound depths. We are all in fine
spirits, feel very gay, and the badinage of
the men is echoed from wall to wall. Now
and then we whistle, or shout, or discharge a
pistol, to listen to the reverberations among
the cliffs.</p>

<p>At night we camp on the south side of the
great Bow-Knot, and, as we eat our supper,
which is spread on the beach, we name this
Labyrinth Cañon.</p>

<p><em>July 16.</em>—Still we go down, on our winding
way. We pass tower cliffs, then we find
the river widens out for several miles, and
meadows are seen on either side, between the
river and the walls. We name this expansion
of the river Tower Park.</p>

<p>At two o’clock we emerge from Labyrinth
Cañon, and go into camp.</p>

<p><em>July 17.</em>—The line which separates
Labyrinth Cañon from the one below is but
a line, and at once, this morning, we enter
another cañon. The water fills the entire<span class="pagenum">[136]</span>
channel, so that nowhere is there room to
land. The walls are low, but vertical, and,
as we proceed, they gradually increase in
altitude. Running a couple of miles, the
river changes its course many degrees, toward
the east. Just here, a little stream
comes in on the right, and the wall is broken
down; so we land, and go out to take a view
of the surrounding country. We are now
down among the buttes, and in a region the
surface of which is naked, solid rock—a
beautiful red sandstone, forming a smooth,
undulating pavement. The Indians call
this the “<em>Toom′-pin Tu-weap′</em>,” or “Rock
Land,” and the “<em>Toom′-pin wu-near′ Tu-weap′</em>,”
or “Land of Standing Rock.”</p>

<p>Off to the south we see a butte, in the form
of a fallen cross. It is several miles away,
still it presents no inconspicuous figure on
the landscape, and must be many hundreds
of feet high, probably more than two thousand.
We note its position on our map, and
name it “The Butte of the Cross.”</p>

<p>We continue our journey. In many<span class="pagenum">[137]</span>
places the walls, which rise from the water’s
edge, are overhanging on either side. The
stream is still quiet, and we glide along,
through a strange, weird, grand region.
The landscape everywhere, away from the
river, is of rock—cliffs of rock; tables of
rock; plateaus of rock; terraces of rock;
crags of rock—ten thousand strangely
carved forms. Rocks everywhere, and no
vegetation; no soil; no sand. In long, gentle
curves, the river winds about these rocks.</p>

<p>When speaking of these rocks, we must
not conceive of piles of boulders, or heaps of
fragments, but a whole land of naked rock,
with giant forms carved on it: cathedral
shaped buttes, towering hundreds or thousands
of feet; cliffs that cannot be scaled,
and cañon walls that shrink the river into
insignificance, with vast, hollow domes, and
tall pinnacles, and shafts set on the verge
overhead, and all highly colored—buff, gray,
red, brown, and chocolate; never lichened;
never moss-covered; but bare, and often polished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[138]</span></p>

<p>We pass a place where two bends of the
river come together, an intervening rock
having been worn away, and a new channel
formed across. The old channel ran in a
great circle around to the right, by what was
once a circular peninsula; then an island;
then the water left the old channel entirely,
and passed through the cut, and the old bed
of the river is dry. So the great circular
rock stands by itself, with precipitous walls
all about it, and we find but one place where
it can be scaled. Looking from its summit,
a long stretch of river is seen, sweeping close
to the overhanging cliffs on the right, but
having a little meadow between it and the
wall on the left. The curve is very gentle
and regular. We name this Bonita Bend.</p>

<p>And just here we climb out once more, to
take another bearing on The Butte of the
Cross. Reaching an eminence, from which
we can overlook the landscape, we are surprised
to find that our butte, with its wonderful
form, is indeed two buttes, one so standing
in front of the other that, from our last<span class="pagenum">[139]</span>
point of view, it gave the appearance of a
cross.</p>

<p>Again, a few miles below Bonita Bend,
we go out a mile or two along the rocks, toward
the Orange Cliffs, passing over terraces
paved with jasper.</p>

<p>The cliffs are not far away, and we soon
reach them, and wander in some deep,
painted alcoves, which attracted our attention
from the river; then we return to our
boats.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon, the water becomes
swift, and our boats make great speed. An
hour of this rapid running brings us to the
junction of the Grand and Green, the foot
of Stillwater Cañon, as we have named it.</p>

<p>These streams unite in solemn depths,
more than one thousand two hundred feet
below the general surface of the country.
The walls of the lower end of Stillwater
Cañon are very beautifully curved, as the
river sweeps in its meandering course. The
lower end of the cañon through which the
Grand comes down, is also regular, but much<span class="pagenum">[140]</span>
more direct, and we look up this stream, and
out into the country beyond, and obtain
glimpses of snow clad peaks, the summits
of a group of mountains known as the Sierra
La Sal. Down the Colorado, the cañon
walls are much broken.</p>

<p>We row around into the Grand, and camp
on its northwest bank; and here we propose
to stay several days, for the purpose of determining
the latitude and longitude, and
the altitude of the walls. Much of the night
is spent in making observations with the sextant.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The distance from the mouth of the Uinta
to the head of the Cañon of Desolation is
twenty and three-quarters miles. The
Cañon of Desolation is ninety-seven miles
long; Gray Cañon thirty-six. The course
of the river through Gunnison’s Valley is
twenty-seven and a quarter miles; Labyrinth
Cañon, sixty-two and a half miles.</p>

<p>In the Cañon of Desolation, the highest
rocks immediately over the river are about<span class="pagenum">[141]</span>
two thousand four hundred feet. This is at
Log Cabin Cliff. The highest part of the
terrace is near the brink of the Brown Cliffs.
Climbing the immediate walls of the cañon,
and passing back to the cañon terrace, and
climbing that, we find the altitude, above
the river, to be 3,300 feet. The lower end of
Gray Cañon is about 2,000 feet; the lower
end of Labyrinth Cañon, 1,300 feet.</p>

<p>Stillwater Cañon is forty-two and three-quarters
miles long; the highest walls, 1,300
feet.</p>

<p class="dropcap">July 18.—The day is spent in obtaining
the time, and spreading our
rations, which, we find, are badly injured.
The flour has been wet and dried
so many times that it is all musty, and full
of hard lumps. We make a sieve of mosquito
netting, and run our flour through it,
losing more than two hundred pounds by
the process. Our losses, by the wrecking
of the <em>No Name</em>, and by various mishaps
since, together with the amount thrown
away to-day, leave us little more than two
months’ supplies, and, to make them last
thus long, we must be fortunate enough to
lose no more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[143]</span></p>

<p>We drag our boats on shore, and turn
them over to recalk and pitch them, and
Sumner is engaged in repairing barometers.
While we are here, for a day or two, resting,
we propose to put everything in the best
shape for a vigorous campaign.</p>

<p><em>July 19.</em>—Bradley and I start this morning
to climb the left wall below the junction.
The way we have selected is up a gulch.
Climbing for an hour over and among the
rocks, we find ourselves in a vast amphitheater,
and our way cut off. We clamber
around to the left for half an hour, until
we find that we cannot go up in that direction.
Then we try the rocks around to the
right, and discover a narrow shelf, nearly
half a mile long. In some places, this is
so wide that we pass along with ease; in others,
it is so narrow and sloping that we are
compelled to lie down and crawl. We can
look over the edge of the shelf, down eight
hundred feet, and see the river rolling and
plunging among the rocks. Looking up
five hundred feet, to the brink of the cliff,<span class="pagenum">[144]</span>
it seems to blend with the sky. We continue
along, until we come to a point where the
wall is again broken down. Up we climb.
On the right, there is a narrow, mural point
of rocks, extending toward the river, two
or three hundred feet high, and six or eight
hundred feet long. We come back to
where this sets in, and find it cut off from
the main wall by a great crevice. Into this
we pass. And now, a long, narrow rock is
between us and the river. The rock itself
is split longitudinally and transversely; and
the rains on the surface above have run down
through the crevices, and gathered into
channels below, and then run off into the
river. The crevices are usually narrow
above, and, by erosion of the streams, wider
below, forming a network of caves; but each
cave having a narrow, winding sky-light up
through the rocks.</p>

<p>We wander among these corridors for an
hour or two, but find no place where the
rocks are broken down, so that we can climb
up. At last, we determine to attempt a passage<span class="pagenum">[145]</span>
by a crevice, and select one which we
think is wide enough to admit of the passage
of our bodies, and yet narrow enough
to climb out by pressing our hands and feet
against the walls. So we climb as men
would out of a well. Bradley climbs first;
I hand him the barometer, then climb over
his head, and he hands me the barometer.
So we pass each other alternately, until we
emerge from the fissure, out on the summit
of the rock. And what a world of grandeur
is spread before us! Below is the
cañon, through which the Colorado runs.
We can trace its course for miles, and at
points catch glimpses of the river. From
the northwest comes the Green, in a narrow,
winding gorge. From the northeast comes
the Grand, through a cañon that seems bottomless
from where we stand. Away to
the west are lines of cliffs and ledges of
rock—not such ledges as you may have seen
where the quarryman splits his blocks, but
ledges from which the gods might quarry
mountains, that, rolled out on the plain below,<span class="pagenum">[146]</span>
would stand a lofty range; and not such
cliffs as you may have seen where the swallow
builds its nest, but cliffs where the soaring
eagle is lost to view ere he reaches the
summit.</p>

<p>Between us and the distant cliffs are the
strangely carved and pinnacled rocks of the
<em>Toom′-pin wu-near′ Tu-weap′</em>. On the
summit of the opposite wall of the cañon are
rock forms that we do not understand.
Away to the east a group of eruptive mountains
are seen—the Sierra La Sal. Their
slopes are covered with pines, and deep
gulches are flanked with great crags, and
snow fields are seen near the summits. So
the mountains are in uniform, green, gray,
and silver. Wherever we look there is but
a wilderness of rocks; deep gorges, where
the rivers are lost below cliffs and towers
and pinnacles; and ten thousand strangely
carved forms in every direction; and beyond
them, mountains blending with the clouds.</p>

<p>Now we return to camp. While we are<span class="pagenum">[147]</span>
eating supper, we very naturally speak of
better fare, as musty bread and spoiled bacon
are not pleasant. Soon I see Hawkins
down by the boat, taking up the sextant,
rather a strange proceeding for him, and
I question him concerning it. He replies
that he is trying to find the latitude and longitude
of the nearest pie.</p>

<p><em>July 20.</em>—This morning, Captain Powell
and I go out to climb the west wall of the
cañon, for the purpose of examining the
strange rocks seen yesterday from the other
side. Two hours bring us to the top, at a
point between the Green and Colorado, overlooking
the junction of the rivers. A long
neck of rock extends toward the mouth of
the Grand. Out on this we walk, crossing
a great number of deep crevices. Usually,
the smooth rock slopes down to the fissure
on either side. Sometimes it is an interesting
question to us whether the slope is not
so steep that we cannot stand on it. Sometimes,
starting down, we are compelled to<span class="pagenum">[148]</span>
go on, and we are not always sure that the
crevice is not too wide for a jump, when we
measure it with our eye from above.</p>

<p>Probably the slopes would not be difficult
if there was not a fissure at the lower end;
nor would the fissures cause fear if they
were but a few feet deep. It is curious how a
little obstacle becomes a great obstruction,
when a misstep would land a man in the
bottom of a deep chasm. Climbing the face
of a cliff, a man will walk along a step or
shelf, but a few inches wide, without hesitancy,
if the landing is but ten feet below,
should he fall; but if the foot of the cliff is
a thousand feet down, he will crawl. At
last our way is cut off by a fissure so deep and
wide that we cannot pass it. Then we turn
and walk back into the country, over the
smooth, naked sandstone, without vegetation,
except that here and there dwarf cedars
and piñon pines have found a footing in the
huge cracks. There are great basins in the
rock, holding water; some but a few gallons,
others hundreds of barrels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[149]</span></p>

<p>The day is spent in walking about through
these strange scenes. A narrow gulch is cut
into the wall of the main cañon. Follow
this up, and you climb rapidly, as if going
up a mountain side, for the gulch heads but
a few hundred or a few thousand yards from
the wall. But this gulch has its side gulches,
and, as you come near to the summit, a group
of radiating cañons is found. The spaces
drained by these little cañons are terraced,
and are, to a greater or less extent, of the
form of amphitheaters, though some are oblong
and some rather irregular. Usually, the
spaces drained by any two of these little side
cañons are separated by a narrow wall, one,
two, or three hundred feet high, and often
but a few feet in thickness. Sometimes the
wall is broken into a line of pyramids above,
and still remains a wall below. Now, there
are a number of these gulches which break
the wall of the main cañon of the Green,
each one having its system of side cañons
and amphitheaters, inclosed by walls, or lines
of pinnacles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[150]</span></p>

<p>The course of the Green, at this point, is
approximately at right angles to that of the
Colorado, and on the brink of the latter
cañon we find the same system of terraced
and walled glens. The walls, and pinnacles,
and towers are of sandstone, homogeneous in
structure, but not in color, as they show
broad bands of red, buff, and gray. This
painting of the rocks, dividing them into sections,
increases their apparent height. In
some places, these terraced and walled glens,
along the Colorado, have coalesced with
those along the Green; that is, the intervening
walls are broken down. It is very
rarely that a loose rock is seen. The sand
is washed off so that the walls, terraces, and
slopes of the glens are all of smooth sandstone.</p>

<p>In the walls themselves, curious caves and
channels have been carved. In some places,
there are little stairways up the walls; in
others, the walls present what are known as
royal arches; and so we wander through
glens, and among pinnacles, and climb the<span class="pagenum">[151]</span>
walls from early morn until late in the afternoon.</p>

<p><em>July 21.</em>—We start this morning on the
Colorado. The river is rough, and bad rapids,
in close succession, are found. Two
very hard portages are made during the forenoon.
After dinner, in running a rapid, the
<em>Emma Dean</em> is swamped, and we are thrown
into the river, we cling to her, and in the
first quiet water below she is righted and
bailed out; but three oars are lost in the
mishap. The larger boats land above the
dangerous place, and we make a portage,
that occupies all the afternoon. We camp
at night, on the rocks on the left bank, and
can scarcely find room to lie down.</p>

<p><em>July 22.</em>—This morning, we continue our
journey, though short of oars. There is no
timber growing on the walls within our
reach, and no drift wood along the banks,
so we are compelled to go on until something
suitable can be found. A mile and three
quarters below, we find a huge pile of drift
wood, among which are some cottonwood<span class="pagenum">[152]</span>
logs. From these we select one which we
think the best, and the men are set at work
sawing oars. Our boats are leaking again,
from the strains received in the bad rapids
yesterday, so, after dinner, they are turned
over, and some of the men are engaged in
calking them.</p>

<p>Captain Powell and I go out to climb the
wall to the east, for we can see dwarf pines
above, and it is our purpose to collect the
resin which oozes from them, to use in pitching
our boats. We take a barometer with
us, and find that the walls are becoming
higher, for now they register an altitude,
above the river, of nearly fifteen hundred
feet.</p>

<p><em>July 23.</em>—On starting, we come at once
to difficult rapids and falls, that, in many
places, are more abrupt than in any of the
cañons through which we have passed, and
we decide to name this Cataract Cañon.</p>

<p>From morning until noon, the course of
the river is to the west; the scenery is grand,
with rapids and falls below, and walls above,<span class="pagenum">[153]</span>
beset with crags and pinnacles. Just at
noon we wheel again to the south, and go
into camp for dinner.</p>

<p>While the cook is preparing it, Bradley,
Captain Powell, and myself go up into a
side cañon, that comes in at this point. We
enter through a very narrow passage, having
to wade along the course of a little stream
until a cascade interrupts our progress.
Then we climb to the right, for a hundred
feet, until we reach a little shelf, along which
we pass, walking with great care, for it is
narrow, until we pass around the fall. Here
the gorge widens into a spacious, sky roofed
chamber. In the farther end is a beautiful
grove of cottonwoods, and between us and
the cottonwoods the little stream widens out
into three clear lakelets, with bottoms of
smooth rock. Beyond the cottonwoods, the
brook tumbles, in a series of white, shining
cascades, from heights that seem immeasurable.
Turning around, we can look through
the cleft through which we came, and see
the river, with towering walls beyond.<span class="pagenum">[154]</span>
What a chamber for a resting place is this!
hewn from the solid rock; the heavens for
a ceiling; cascade fountains within; a grove
in the conservatory, clear lakelets for a refreshing
bath, and an outlook through the
doorway on a raging river, with cliffs and
mountains beyond.</p>

<p>Our way, after dinner, is through a gorge,
grand beyond description. The walls are
nearly vertical; the river broad and swift,
but free from rocks and falls. From the
edge of the water to the brink of the cliffs
it is one thousand six hundred to one thousand
eight hundred feet. At this great
depth, the river rolls in solemn majesty.
The cliffs are reflected from the more quiet
river, and we seem to be in the depths of
the earth, and yet can look down into the
waters that reflect a bottomless abyss. We
arrive, early in the afternoon, at the head of
more rapids and falls, but, wearied with past
work, we determine to rest, so go into camp,
and the afternoon and evening are spent by
the men in discussing the probabilities of<span class="pagenum">[155]</span>
successfully navigating the river below. The
barometric records are examined, to see what
descent we have made since we left the mouth
of the Grand, and what descent since we
left the Pacific Railroad, and what fall there
yet must be to the river, ere we reach the end
of the great cañons. The conclusion to
which the men arrive seems to be about this:
that there are great descents yet to be made,
but, if they are distributed in rapids and
short falls, as they have been heretofore, we
will be able to overcome them. But, may
be, we shall come to a fall in these cañons
which we cannot pass, where the walls rise
from the water’s edge, so that we cannot
land, and where the water is so swift that
we cannot return. Such places have been
found, except that the falls were not so
great but that we could run them with safety.
How will it be in the future! So they speculate
over the serious probabilities in jesting
mood, and I hear Sumner remark, “My idea
is, we had better go slow, and learn to peddle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[156]</span></p>

<p><em>July 24.</em>—We examine the rapids below.
Large rocks have fallen from the walls—great,
angular blocks, which have rolled
down the talus, and are strewn along the
channel. We are compelled to make three
portages in succession, the distance being
less than three-fourths of a mile, with a fall
of seventy-five feet. Among these rocks,
in chutes, whirlpools, and great waves, with
rushing breakers and foam, the water finds
its way, still tumbling down. We stop for
the night, only three-fourths of a mile below
the last camp. A very hard day’s work
has been done, and at evening I sit on a
rock by the edge of the river, to look at the
water, and listen to its roar. Hours ago,
deep shadows had settled into the cañon
as the sun passed behind the cliffs. Now,
doubtless, the sun has gone down, for we
can see no glint of light on the crags above.
Darkness is coming on. The waves are rolling,
with crests of foam so white they seem
almost to give a light of their own. Near by,
a chute of water strikes the foot of a great<span class="pagenum">[157]</span>
block of limestone, fifty feet high, and the
waters pile up against it, and roll back.
Where there are sunken rocks, the water
heaps up in mounds, or even in cones. At
a point where rocks come very near the surface,
the water forms a chute above, strikes,
and is shot up ten or fifteen feet, and piles
back in gentle curves, as in a fountain; and
on the river tumbles and rolls.</p>

<p><em>July 25.</em>—Still more rapids and falls to-day.
In one, the <em>Emma Dean</em> is caught
in a whirlpool, and set spinning about; and
it is with great difficulty we are able to get
out of it, with the loss of an oar. At noon,
another is made; and on we go, running
some of the rapids, letting down with lines
past others, and making two short portages.
We camp on the right bank, hungry and
tired.</p>

<p><em>July 26.</em>—We run a short distance this
morning, and go into camp, to make oars
and repair boats and barometers. The
walls of the cañon have been steadily increasing
in altitude to this point, and now they<span class="pagenum">[158]</span>
are more than two thousand feet high. In
many places, they are vertical from the
water’s edge; in others, there is a talus between
the river and the foot of the cliffs, and
they are often broken down by side cañons.
It is probable that the river is nearly as low
now as it is ever found. High water mark
can be observed forty, fifty, sixty, or a hundred
feet above its present stage. Sometimes
logs and drift wood are seen wedged into the
crevice overhead, where floods have carried
them.</p>

<p>About ten o’clock, Powell, Bradley, Howland,
Hall, and myself start up a side cañon
to the east. We soon come to pools of
water; then to a brook, which is lost in the
sands below; and, passing up the brook, we
find the cañon narrows, the walls close in,
are often overhanging, and at last we find
ourselves in a vast amphitheater, with a pool
of deep, clear, cold water on the bottom.
At first, our way seems cut off; but we soon
discover a little shelf, along which we climb,
and, passing beyond the pool, walk a hundred<span class="pagenum">[159]</span>
yards or more, turn to the right, and
find ourselves in another dome-shaped amphitheater.
There is a winding cleft at the
top, reaching out to the country above,
nearly two thousand feet overhead. The
rounded, basin shaped bottom is filled with
water to the foot of the walls. There is
no shelf by which we can pass around the
foot. If we swim across, we meet with a
face of rock hundreds of feet high, over
which a little rill glides, and it will be impossible
to climb. So we can go no further
up this cañon. Then we turn back, and
examine the walls on either side carefully,
to discover, if possible, some way of climbing
out.</p>

<p>In this search, every man takes his own
course, and we are scattered. I almost abandon
the idea of getting out, and am engaged
in searching for fossils, when I discover, on
the north, a broken place, up which it may
be possible for me to climb. The way, for
a distance, is up a slide of rocks; then up
an irregular amphitheater, on points that<span class="pagenum">[160]</span>
form steps and give handhold, and then I
reach a little shelf, along which I walk, and
discover a vertical fissure, parallel to the
face of the wall, and reaching to a higher
shelf. This fissure is narrow, and I try to
climb up to the bench, which is about forty
feet overhead. I have a barometer on my
back, which rather impedes my climbing.
The walls of the fissure are of smooth limestone,
offering neither foot nor hand hold.
So I support myself by pressing my back
against one wall and my knees against the
other, and, in this way, lift my body, in a
shuffling manner, a few inches at a time,
until I have, perhaps, made twenty-five feet
of the distance, when the crevice widens a
little, and I cannot press my knees against
the rocks in front with sufficient power to
give me support in lifting my body, and I
try to go back. This I cannot do without
falling. So I struggle along sidewise,
farther into the crevice, where it narrows.
But by this time my muscles are exhausted,
and I cannot climb longer; so I move still<span class="pagenum">[161]</span>
a little farther into the crevice, where it is
so narrow and wedging that I can lie in it,
and there I rest.</p>

<p>Five or ten minutes of this relief, and up
once more I go, and reach the bench above.
On this I can walk for a quarter of a mile,
till I come to a place where the wall is again
broken down, so that I can climb up still
farther, and in an hour I reach the summit.
I hang up my barometer, to give it a few
minutes’ time to settle, and occupy myself
in collecting resin from the piñon pines,
which are found in great abundance. One
of the principal objects in making this climb
was to get this resin, for the purpose of
smearing our boats; but I have with me no
means of carrying it down. The day is very
hot, and my coat was left in camp, so I have
no linings to tear out. Then it occurs to
me to cut off the sleeve of my shirt, tie it
up at one end, and in this little sack I collect
about a gallon of pitch.</p>

<p>After taking observations for altitude, I
wander back on the rock, for an hour or<span class="pagenum">[162]</span>
two, when suddenly I notice that a storm
is coming from the south. I seek a shelter
in the rocks; but when the storm bursts, it
comes down as a flood from the heavens, not
with gentle drops at first, slowly increasing
in quantity, but as if suddenly poured out.
I am thoroughly drenched, and almost
washed away. It lasts not more than half
an hour, when the clouds sweep by to the
north, and I have sunshine again.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I have discovered a better
way of getting down, and I start for
camp, making the greatest haste possible.
On reaching the bottom of the side cañon,
I find a thousand streams rolling down the
cliffs on every side, carrying with them red
sand; and these all unite in the cañon below,
in one great stream of red mud.</p>

<p>Traveling as fast as I can run, I soon reach
the foot of the stream, for the rain did not
reach the lower end of the cañon, and the
water is running down a dry bed of sand;
and, although it comes in waves, several feet
high and fifteen or twenty feet in width,<span class="pagenum">[163]</span>
the sands soak it up, and it is lost. But
wave follows wave, and rolls along, and is
swallowed up; and still the floods come on
from above. I find that I can travel faster
than the stream; so I hasten to camp, and
tell the men there is a river coming down
the cañon. We carry our camp equipage
hastily from the bank, to where we think it
will be above the water. Then we stand by,
and see the river roll on to join the Colorado.
Great quantities of gypsum are
found at the bottom of the gorge; so we name
it Gypsum Cañon.</p>

<p><em>July 27.</em>—We have more rapids and falls
until noon; then we come to a narrow place
in the cañon, with vertical walls for several
hundred feet, above which are steep
steps and sloping rocks back to the summits.
The river is very narrow, and we make our
way with great care and much anxiety, hugging
the wall on the left, and carefully examining
the way before us.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon, we pass to the left,
around a sharp point, which is somewhat<span class="pagenum">[164]</span>
broken down near the foot, and discover a
flock of mountain sheep on the rocks, more
than a hundred feet above us. We quickly
land in a cove, out of sight, and away go
all the hunters with their guns, for the sheep
have not discovered us. Soon, we hear firing,
and those of us who have remained in
the boats climb up to see what success the
hunters have had. One sheep has been
killed, and two of the men are still pursuing
them. In a few minutes, we hear firing
again, and the next moment down come the
flock, clattering over the rocks, within
twenty yards of us. One of the hunters
seizes his gun, and brings a second sheep
down, and the next minute the remainder
of the flock is lost behind the rocks. We
all give chase; but it is impossible to follow
their tracks over the naked rock, and we
see them no more. Where they went out
of this rock walled cañon is a mystery, for
we can see no way of escape. Doubtless,
if we could spare the time for the search,<span class="pagenum">[165]</span>
we could find some gulch up which they
ran.</p>

<p>We lash our prizes to the deck of one of
the boats, and go on for a short distance;
but fresh meat is too tempting for us, and we
stop early to have a feast. And a feast it
is! Two fine, young sheep. We care not
for bread, or beans, or dried apples to-night;
coffee and mutton is all we ask.</p>

<p><em>July 28.</em>—We make two portages this
morning, one of them very long. During
the afternoon we run a chute, more than
half a mile in length, narrow and rapid.
This chute has a floor of marble; the rocks
dip in the direction in which we are going,
and the fall of the stream conforms to the
inclination of the beds; so we float on water
that is gliding down an inclined plane. At
the foot of the chute, the river turns sharply
to the right, and the water rolls up against
a rock which, from above, seems to stand
directly athwart its course. As we approach
it, we pull with all our power to the right,<span class="pagenum">[166]</span>
but it seems impossible to avoid being carried
headlong against the cliff, and we are
carried up high on the waves—not against
the rocks, for the rebounding water strikes
us, and we are beaten back, and pass on with
safety, except that we get a good drenching.</p>

<p>After this, the walls suddenly close in, so
that the cañon is narrower than we have
ever known it. The water fills it from wall
to wall, giving us no landing place at the
foot of the cliff; the river is very swift, the
cañon is very tortuous, so that we can see
but a few hundred yards ahead; the walls
tower over us, often overhanging so as to
almost shut out the light. I stand on deck,
watching with intense anxiety, lest this may
lead us into some danger; but we glide along,
with no obstruction, no falls, no rocks, and,
in a mile and a half, emerge from the narrow
gorge into a more open and broken portion
of the cañon. Now that it is past, it seems
a very simple thing indeed to run through<span class="pagenum">[167]</span>
such a place, but the fear of what might be
ahead made a deep impression on us.</p>

<p>At three o’clock we arrive at the foot of
Cataract Cañon. Here a long cañon valley
comes down from the east, and the river turns
sharply to the west in a continuation of the
line of the lateral valley. In the bend on
the right, vast numbers of crags, and pinnacles,
and tower shaped rocks are seen. We
call it Mille Crag Bend.</p>

<p>And now we wheel into another cañon, on
swift water, unobstructed by rocks. This
new cañon is very narrow and very straight,
with walls vertical below and terraced
above. The brink of the cliff is 1,300 feet
above the water, where we enter it, but the
rocks dip to the west, and, as the course of
the cañon is in that direction, the walls are
seen to slowly decrease in altitude. Floating
down this narrow channel, and looking
out through the cañon crevice away in the
distance, the river is seen to turn again to the
left, and beyond this point, away many miles,<span class="pagenum">[168]</span>
a great mountain is seen. Still floating
down, we see other mountains, now to the
right, now on the left, until a great mountain
range is unfolded to view. We name
this Narrow Cañon, and it terminates at the
bend of the river below.</p>

<p>As we go down to this point, we discover
the mouth of a stream, which enters from the
right. Into this our little boat is turned.
One of the men in the boat following, seeing
what we have done, shouts to Dunn,
asking if it is a trout-stream. Dunn replies,
much disgusted, that it is “a dirty devil,”
and by this name the river is to be known
hereafter.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The water is exceedingly
muddy, and has an unpleasant odor.</p>

<p>Some of us go out for half a mile, and
climb a butte to the north. The course of
the Dirty Devil River can be traced for
many miles. It comes down through a very
narrow cañon, and beyond it, to the southwest,
there is a long line of cliffs, with a
broad terrace, or bench, between it and the<span class="pagenum">[169]</span>
brink of the cañon, and beyond these cliffs
is situated the range of mountains seen as
we came down Narrow Cañon.</p>

<p>Looking up the Colorado, the chasm
through which it runs can be seen, but we
cannot look down on its waters. The whole
country is a region of naked rock, of many
colors, with cliffs and buttes about us, and
towering mountains in the distance.</p>

<p><em>July 29.</em>—We enter a cañon to-day, with
low, red walls. A short distance below its
head we discover the ruins of an old building,
on the left wall. There is a narrow
plain between the river and the wall just
here, and on the brink of a rock two hundred
feet high stands this old house. Its
walls are of stone, laid in mortar, with much
regularity. It was probably built three
stories high; the lower story is yet almost
intact; the second is much broken down, and
scarcely anything is left of the third. Great
quantities of flint chips are found on the
rocks near by, and many arrow heads, some
perfect, others broken; and fragments of<span class="pagenum">[170]</span>
pottery are strewn about in great profusion.
On the face of the cliff, under the building,
and along down the river, for two or three
hundred yards, there are many etchings.
Two hours are given to the examination of
these interesting ruins, then we run down
fifteen miles farther, and discover another
group. The principal building was situated
on the summit of the hill. A part of
the walls are standing, to the height of eight
or ten feet, and the mortar yet remains, in
some places. The house was in the shape
of an L, with five rooms on the ground
floor, one in the angle, and two in each extension.
In the space in the angle, there is
a deep excavation. From what we know
of the people in the province of Tusayan,
who are, doubtless, of the same race as the
former inhabitants of these ruins, we conclude
that this was a “kiva,” or underground
chamber, in which their religious ceremonies
were performed.</p>

<p>We leave these ruins, and run down two
or three miles, and go into camp about midafternoon.<span class="pagenum">[171]</span>
And now I climb the wall and
go out into the back country for a walk.</p>

<p>The sandstone, through which the cañon
is cut, is red and homogeneous, being the
same as that through which Labyrinth
runs. The smooth, naked rock stretches
out on either side of the river for many miles,
but curiously carved mounds and cones are
scattered everywhere, and deep holes are
worn out. Many of these pockets are filled
with water. In one of these holes, or wells,
twenty feet deep, I find a tree growing.
The excavation is so narrow that I can step
from its brink to a limb on the tree, and
descend to the bottom of the well down a
growing ladder. Many of these pockets are
pot-holes, being found in the courses of little
rills, or brooks, that run during the rains
which occasionally fall in this region; and
often a few harder rocks, which evidently
assisted in their excavation, can be found in
their bottoms. Others, which are shallower,
are not so easily explained. Perhaps they
are found where softer spots existed in the<span class="pagenum">[172]</span>
sandstone, places that yielded more readily
to atmospheric degradation, and where the
loose sands were carried away by the winds.</p>

<p>Just before sundown, I attempt to climb
a rounded eminence, from which I hope to
obtain a good outlook on the surrounding
country. It is formed of smooth mounds,
piled one above another. Up these I climb,
winding here and there, to find a practicable
way, until near the summit they become too
steep for me to proceed. I search about, a
few minutes, for a more easy way, when I
am surprised at finding a stairway, evidently
cut in the rock by hands. At one place,
where there is a vertical wall of ten or twelve
feet, I find an old, ricketty ladder. It may
be that this was a watch-tower of that ancient
people whose homes we have found in ruins.
On many of the tributaries of the Colorado
I have heretofore examined their deserted
dwellings. Those that show evidences of
being built during the latter part of their
occupation of the country, are, usually,
placed on the most inaccessible cliffs. Sometimes,<span class="pagenum">[173]</span>
the mouths of caves have been walled
across, and there are many other evidences
to show their anxiety to secure defensible
positions. Probably the nomadic tribes
were sweeping down upon them, and they
resorted to these cliffs and cañons for safety.
It is not unreasonable to suppose that this
orange mound was used as a watch-tower.
Here I stand, where these now lost people
stood centuries ago, and look over this
strange country. I gaze off to great mountains,
in the northwest, which are slowly covered
by the night until they are lost, and
then I return to camp. It is no easy task
to find my way down the wall in the darkness,
and I clamber about until it is nearly
midnight, before I arrive.</p>

<p><em>July 30.</em>—We make good progress to-day,
as the water, though smooth, is swift.
Sometimes, the cañon walls are vertical to
the top; sometimes, they are vertical below,
and have a mound covered slope above; in
other places, the slope, with its mounds,
comes down to the water’s edge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[174]</span></p>

<p>Still proceeding on our way, we find the
orange sandstone is cut in two by a group
of firm, calcareous strata, and the lower bed
is underlaid by soft gypsiferous shales.
Sometimes, the upper homogeneous bed is
a smooth, vertical wall, but usually it is
carved with mounds, with gently meandering
valley lines. The lower bed, yielding
to gravity, as the softer shales below work
out into the river, breaks into angular surfaces,
often having a columnar appearance.
One could almost imagine that the walls had
been carved with a purpose, to represent
giant architectural forms.</p>

<p>In the deep recesses of the walls, we find
springs, with mosses and ferns on the moistened
sandstone.</p>

<p><em>July 31.</em>—We have a cool, pleasant ride
to-day, through this part of the cañon. The
walls are steadily increasing in altitude, the
curves are gentle, and often the river sweeps
by an arc of vertical wall, smooth and unbroken,
and then by a curve that is variegated<span class="pagenum">[175]</span>
by royal arches, mossy alcoves, deep,
beautiful glens, and painted grottos.</p>

<p>Soon after dinner, we discover the mouth
of the San Juan, where we camp. The remainder
of the afternoon is given to hunting
some way by which we can climb out of the
cañon; but it ends in failure.</p>

<p><em>August 1.</em>—We drop down two miles this
morning, and go into camp again. There
is a low, willow covered strip of land along
the walls on the east. Across this we walk,
to explore an alcove which we see from the
river. On entering, we find a little grove
of box-elder and cottonwood trees; and,
turning to the right, we find ourselves in a
vast chamber, carved out of the rock. At
the upper end there is a clear, deep pool of
water, bordered with verdure. Standing by
the side of this, we can see the grove at the
entrance. The chamber is more than two
hundred feet high, five hundred feet long,
and two hundred feet wide. Through the
ceiling, and on through the rocks for a thousand<span class="pagenum">[176]</span>
feet above, there is a narrow, winding
skylight; and this is all carved out by a little
stream, which only runs during the few
showers that fall now and then in this arid
country. The waters from the bare rocks
back of the cañon, gathering rapidly into a
small channel, have eroded a deep side
cañon, through which they run, until they
fall into the farther end of this chamber.
The rock at the ceiling is hard, the rock below,
very soft and friable; and, having cut
through the upper harder portion down into
the lower and softer, the stream has washed
out these friable sandstones; and thus the
chamber has been excavated.</p>

<p>Here we bring our camp. When “Old
Shady” sings us a song at night, we are
pleased to find that this hollow in the rock
is filled with sweet sounds. It was doubtless
made for an academy of music by its
storm born architects; so we name it Music
Temple.</p>

<p><em>August 2.</em>—We still keep our camp in
Music Temple to-day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[177]</span></p>

<p>I wish to obtain a view of the adjacent
country, if possible; so, early in the morning,
the men take me across the river, and I pass
along by the foot of the cliff half a mile up
stream, and then climb first up broken ledges,
then two or three hundred yards up a smooth,
sloping rock, and then pass out on a narrow
ridge. Still, I find I have not attained an
altitude from which I can overlook the region
outside of the cañon; and so I descend
into a little gulch, and climb again to a
higher ridge, all the way along naked sandstone,
and at last I reach a point of commanding
view. I can look several miles up
the San Juan, and a long distance up the
Colorado; and away to the northwest I can
see the Henry Mountains; to the northeast,
the Sierra La Sal; to the southeast, unknown
mountains; and to the southwest, the meandering
of the cañon. Then I return to the
bank of the river.</p>

<p>We sleep again in Music Temple.</p>

<p><em>August 3.</em>—Start early this morning.
The features of this cañon are greatly diversified.<span class="pagenum">[178]</span>
Still vertical walls at times.
These are usually found to stand above great
curves. The river, sweeping around these
bends, undermines the cliffs in places.
Sometimes, the rocks are overhanging; in
other curves, curious, narrow glens are
found. Through these we climb, by a rough
stairway, perhaps several hundred feet, to
where a spring bursts out from under an
overhanging cliff, and where cottonwoods
and willows stand, while, along the curves of
the brooklet, oaks grow, and other rich vegetation
is seen, in marked contrast to the general
appearance of naked rock. We call
these Oak Glens.</p>

<p>Other wonderful features are the many side
cañons or gorges that we pass. Sometimes,
we stop to explore these for a short distance.
In some places, their walls are much nearer
each other above than below, so that they
look somewhat like caves or chambers in the
rocks. Usually, in going up such a gorge,
we find beautiful vegetation; but our way is<span class="pagenum">[179]</span>
often cut off by deep basins, or pot-holes, as
they are called.</p>

<p>On the walls, and back many miles into
the country, numbers of monument shaped
buttes are observed. So we have a curious
<i lang="fr">ensemble</i> of wonderful features—carved
walls, royal arches, glens, alcove gulches,
mounds, and monuments. From which of
these features shall we select a name? We
decide to call it Glen Cañon.</p>

<p>Past these towering monuments, past
these mounded billows of orange sandstone,
past these oak set glens, past these fern
decked alcoves, past these mural curves, we
glide hour after hour, stopping now and
then, as our attention is arrested by some
new wonder, until we reach a point which is
historic.</p>

<p>In the year 1776, Father Escalante, a
Spanish priest, made an expedition from
Santa Fé to the northwest, crossing the
Grand and Green, and then passing down
along the Wasatch Mountains and the southern<span class="pagenum">[180]</span>
plateaus, until he reached the Rio Virgen.
His intention was to cross to the Mission
of Monterey; but, from information received
from the Indians, he decided that the
route was impracticable. Not wishing to
return to Santa Fé over the circuitous route
by which he had just traveled, he attempted
to go by one more direct, and which led him
across the Colorado, at a point known as
<i lang="es">El vado de los Padres</i>. From the description
which we have read, we are enabled to
determine the place. A little stream comes
down through a very narrow side cañon from
the west. It was down this that he came,
and our boats are lying at the point where
the ford crosses. A well beaten Indian trail
is seen here yet. Between the cliff and the
river there is a little meadow. The ashes
of many camp fires are seen, and the bones
of numbers of cattle are bleaching on the
grass. For several years the Navajos have
raided on the Mormons that dwell in the valleys
to the west, and they doubtless cross<span class="pagenum">[181]</span>
frequently at this ford with their stolen cattle.</p>

<p><em>August 4.</em>—To-day the walls grow higher,
and the cañon much narrower. Monuments
are still seen on either side; beautiful glens,
and alcoves, and gorges, and side cañons are
yet found. After dinner, we find the river
making a sudden turn to the northwest, and
the whole character of the cañon changed.
The walls are many hundreds of feet higher,
and the rocks are chiefly variegated shales
of beautiful colors—creamy orange above,
then bright vermilion, and below, purple and
chocolate beds, with green and yellow sands.
We run four miles through this, in a direction
a little to the west of north; wheel again
to the west, and pass into a portion of the
cañon where the characteristics are more like
those above the bend. At night we stop at
the mouth of a creek coming in from the
right, and suppose it to be the Paria, which
was described to me last year by a Mormon
missionary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[182]</span></p>

<p>Here the cañon terminates abruptly in a
line of cliffs, which stretches from either side
across the river.</p>

<p><em>August 5.</em>—With some feeling of anxiety,
we enter a new cañon this morning. We
have learned to closely observe the texture
of the rock. In softer strata, we have a
quiet river; in harder, we find rapids and
falls. Below us are the limestones and hard
sandstones, which we found in Cataract
Cañon. This bodes toil and danger. Besides
the texture of the rocks, there is another
condition which affects the character
of the channel, as we have found by experience.
Where the strata are horizontal, the
river is often quiet; but, even though it may
be very swift in places, no great obstacles are
found. Where the rocks incline in the direction
traveled, the river usually sweeps
with great velocity, but still we have few rapids
and falls. But where the rocks dip up
stream, and the river cuts obliquely across
the upturned formations, harder strata
above, and softer below, we have rapids and<span class="pagenum">[183]</span>
falls. Into hard rocks, and into rocks dipping
up stream, we pass this morning, and
start on a long, rocky, mad rapid. On the
left there is a vertical rock, and down by this
cliff and around to the left we glide, just
tossed enough by the waves to appreciate
the rate at which we are traveling.</p>

<p>The cañon is narrow, with vertical walls,
which gradually grow higher. More rapids
and falls are found. We come to one
with a drop of sixteen feet, around which
we make a portage, and then stop for dinner.</p>

<p>Then a run of two miles, and another portage,
long and difficult; then we camp for the
night, on a bank of sand.</p>

<p><em>August 6.</em>—Cañon walls, still higher and
higher, as we go down through strata. There
is a steep talus at the foot of the cliff, and,
in some places, the upper parts of the walls
are terraced.</p>

<p>About ten o’clock we come to a place
where the river occupies the entire channel,
and the walls are vertical from the water’s<span class="pagenum">[184]</span>
edge. We see a fall below, and row up
against the cliff. There is a little shelf, or
rather a horizontal crevice, a few feet over
our heads. One man stands on the deck of
the boat, another climbs on his shoulders, and
then into the crevice. Then we pass him
a line, and two or three others, with myself,
follow; then we pass along the crevice until
it becomes a shelf, as the upper part, or roof,
is broken off. On this we walk for a short
distance, slowly climbing all the way, until
we reach a point where the shelf is broken
off, and we can pass no farther. Then we
go back to the boat, cross the stream, and
get some logs that have lodged in the rocks,
bring them to our side, pass them along the
crevice and shelf, and bridge over the broken
place. Then we go on to a point over the
falls, but do not obtain a satisfactory view.
Then we climb out to the top of the wall, and
walk along to find a point below the fall,
from which it can be seen. From this point
it seems possible to let down our boats, with
lines, to the head of the rapids, and then<span class="pagenum">[185]</span>
make a portage; so we return, row down by
the side of the cliff, as far as we dare, and
fasten one of the boats to a rock. Then we
let down another boat to the end of its line
beyond the first, and the third boat to the
end of its line below the second, which brings
it to the head of the fall, and under an overhanging
rock. Then the upper boat, in
obedience to a signal, lets go; we pull in the
line, and catch the nearest boat as it comes,
and then the last. Then we make a portage,
and go on.</p>

<p>We go into camp early this afternoon, at
a place where it seems possible to climb out,
and the evening is spent in “making observations
for time.”</p>

<p><em>August 7.</em>—The almanac tells us that we
are to have an eclipse of the sun to-day, so
Captain Powell and myself start early, taking
our instruments with us, for the purpose
of making observations on the eclipse, to
determine our longitude. Arriving at the
summit, after four hours’ hard climbing, to
attain 2,300 feet in height, we hurriedly build<span class="pagenum">[186]</span>
a platform of rocks, on which to place our
instruments, and quietly wait for the eclipse;
but clouds come on, and rain falls, and sun
and moon are obscured.</p>

<p>Much disappointed, we start on our return
to camp, but it is late, and the clouds make
the night very dark. Still we feel our way
down among the rocks with great care, for
two or three hours, though making slow
progress indeed. At last we lose our way,
and dare proceed no farther. The rain
comes down in torrents, and we can find no
shelter. We can neither climb up nor go
down, and in the darkness dare not move
about, but sit and “weather out” the night.</p>

<p><em>August 8.</em>—Daylight comes, after a long,
oh! how long a night, and we soon reach
camp.</p>

<p>After breakfast we start again, and make
two portages during the forenoon.</p>

<p>The limestone of this cañon is often polished,
and makes a beautiful marble. Sometimes
the rocks are of many colors—white,
gray, pink, and purple, with saffron tints.<span class="pagenum">[187]</span>
It is with very great labor that we make
progress, meeting with many obstructions,
running rapids, letting down our boats with
lines, from rock to rock, and sometimes carrying
boats and cargoes around bad places.
We camp at night, just after a hard portage,
under an overhanging wall, glad to find shelter
from the rain. We have to search for
some time to find a few sticks of driftwood,
just sufficient to boil a cup of coffee.</p>

<p>The water sweeps rapidly in this elbow of
river, and has cut its way under the rock,
excavating a vast half circular chamber,
which, if utilized for a theater, would give
sitting to fifty thousand people. Objections
might be raised against it, from the fact that,
at high water, the floor is covered with a raging
flood.</p>

<p><em>August 9.</em>—And now, the scenery is on a
grand scale. The walls of the cañon, 2,500
feet high, are of marble, of many beautiful
colors, and often polished below by the
waves, or far up the sides, where showers
have washed the sands over the cliffs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[188]</span></p>

<p>At one place I have a walk, for more than
a mile, on a marble pavement, all polished
and fretted with strange devices, and embossed
in a thousand fantastic patterns.
Through a cleft in the wall the sun shines on
this pavement, which gleams in iridescent
beauty.</p>

<p>I pass up into the cleft. It is very narrow,
with a succession of pools standing at
higher levels as I go back. The water in
these pools is clear and cool, coming down
from springs. Then I return to the pavement,
which is but a terrace or bench, over
which the river runs at its flood, but left bare
at present. Along the pavement, in many
places, are basins of clear water, in strange
contrast to the red mud of the river. At
length I come to the end of this marble terrace,
and take again to the boat.</p>

<p>Riding down a short distance, a beautiful
view is presented. The river turns sharply
to the east, and seems inclosed by a wall, set
with a million brilliant gems. What can it<span class="pagenum">[189]</span>
mean? Every eye is engaged, every one
wonders. On coming nearer, we find fountains
bursting from the rock, high overhead,
and the spray in the sunshine forms the
gems which bedeck the wall. The rocks below
the fountain are covered with mosses,
and ferns, and many beautiful flowering
plants. We name it Vasey’s Paradise, in
honor of the botanist who traveled with us
last year.</p>

<p>We pass many side cañons to-day, that
are dark, gloomy passages, back into the
heart of the rocks that form the plateau
through which this cañon is cut.</p>

<p>It rains again this afternoon. Scarcely
do the first drops fall, when little rills run
down the walls. As the storm comes on,
the little rills increase in size, until great
streams are formed. Although the walls of
the cañon are chiefly limestone, the adjacent
country is of red sandstone; and now the waters,
loaded with these sands, come down in
rivers of bright red mud, leaping over the<span class="pagenum">[190]</span>
walls in innumerable cascades. It is plain
now how these walls are polished in many
places.</p>

<p>At last, the storm ceases, and we go on.
We have cut through the sandstones and
limestones met in the upper part of the
cañon, and through one great bed of marble
a thousand feet in thickness. In this, great
numbers of caves are hollowed out, and carvings
are seen, which suggest architectural
forms, though on a scale so grand that architectural
terms belittle them. As this great
bed forms a distinctive feature of the cañon,
we call it Marble Cañon.</p>

<p>It is a peculiar feature of these walls, that
many projections are set out into the river,
as if the wall was buttressed for support.
The walls themselves are half a mile high,
and these buttresses are on a corresponding
scale, jutting into the river scores of feet.
In the recesses between these projections
there are quiet bays, except at the foot of a
rapid, when they are dancing eddies or whirlpools.
Sometimes these alcoves have caves<span class="pagenum">[191]</span>
at the back, giving them the appearance of
great depth. Then other caves are seen
above, forming vast, dome shaped chambers.
The walls, and buttresses, and chambers are
all of marble.</p>

<p>The river is now quiet; the cañon wider.
Above, when the river is at its flood, the waters
gorge up, so that the difference between
high and low water mark is often fifty or
even seventy feet; but here, high-water mark
is not more than twenty feet above the present
stage of the river. Sometimes there is
a narrow flood plain between the water and
the wall.</p>

<p>Here we first discover <i lang="es">mesquite</i> shrubs,
or small trees, with finely divided leaves and
pods, somewhat like the locust.</p>

<p><em>August 10.</em>—Walls still higher; water,
swift again. We pass several broad, ragged
cañons on our right, and up through these we
catch glimpses of a forest clad plateau, miles
away to the west.</p>

<p>At two o’clock, we reach the mouth of the
Colorado Chiquito. This stream enters<span class="pagenum">[192]</span>
through a cañon, on a scale quite as grand
as that of the Colorado itself. It is a very
small river, and exceedingly muddy and salt.
I walk up the stream three or four miles,
this afternoon, crossing and recrossing where
I can easily wade it. Then I climb several
hundred feet at one place, and can see up the
chasm, through which the river runs, for several
miles. On my way back, I kill two rattlesnakes,
and find, on my arrival, that another
has been killed just at camp.</p>

<p><em>August 11.</em>—We remain at this point to-day
for the purpose of determining the latitude
and longitude, measuring the height of
the walls, drying our rations, and repairing
our boats.</p>

<p>Captain Powell, early in the morning,
takes a barometer, and goes out to climb a
point between the two rivers.</p>

<p>I walk down the gorge to the left at the
foot of the cliff, climb to a bench, and discover
a trail, deeply worn in the rock.
Where it crosses the side gulches, in some
places, steps have been cut. I can see no<span class="pagenum">[193]</span>
evidence of its having been traveled for a
long time. It was doubtless a path used by
the people who inhabited this country anterior
to the present Indian races—the people
who built the communal houses, of which
mention has been made.</p>

<p>I return to camp about three o’clock, and
find that some of the men have discovered
ruins, and many fragments of pottery; also,
etchings and hieroglyphics on the rocks.</p>

<p>We find, to-night, on comparing the readings
of the barometers, that the walls are
about three thousand feet high—more than
half a mile—an altitude difficult to appreciate
from a mere statement of feet. The
ascent is made, not by a slope such as is usually
found in climbing a mountain, but is
much more abrupt—often vertical for many
hundreds of feet—so that the impression is
that we are at great depths; and we look up
to see but a little patch of sky.</p>

<p>Between the two streams, above the Colorado
Chiquito, in some places the rocks are
broken and shelving for six or seven hundred<span class="pagenum">[194]</span>
feet; then there is a sloping terrace, which
can only be climbed by finding some way up
a gulch; then, another terrace, and back, still
another cliff. The summit of the cliff is
three thousand feet above the river, as our
barometers attest.</p>

<p>Our camp is below the Colorado Chiquito,
and on the eastern side of the cañon.</p>

<p><em>August 12.</em>—The rocks above camp are
rust colored sandstones and conglomerates.
Some are very hard; others quite soft.
These all lie nearly horizontal, and the beds
of softer material have been washed out, and
left the harder, thus forming a series of
shelves. Long lines of these are seen, of
varying thickness, from one or two to twenty
or thirty feet, and the spaces between have
the same variability. This morning, I spend
two or three hours in climbing among these
shelves, and then I pass above them, and go
up a long slope, to the foot of the cliff, and
try to discover some way by which I can
reach the top of the wall; but I find my
progress cut off by an amphitheater. Then,<span class="pagenum">[195]</span>
I wander away around to the left, up a little
gulch, and along benches, and climb, from
time to time, until I reach an altitude of
nearly two thousand feet, and can get no
higher. From this point, I can look off to
the west, up side cañons of the Colorado,
and see the edge of a great plateau, from
which streams run down into the Colorado,
and deep gulches, in the escarpment which
faces us, continued by cañons, ragged and
flaring, and set with cliffs and towering
crags, down to the river. I can see far up
Marble Cañon, to long lines of chocolate colored
cliffs, and above these, the Vermilion
Cliffs. I can see, also, up the Colorado Chiquito,
through a very ragged and broken
cañon, with sharp salients set out from the
walls on either side, their points overlapping,
so that a huge tooth of marble, on one
side, seems to be set between two teeth on
the opposite; and I can also get glimpses of
walls, standing away back from the river,
while over my head are mural escarpments,
not possible to be scaled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[196]</span></p>

<p>Cataract Cañon is forty-one miles long.
The walls are 1,300 feet high at its head,
and they gradually increase in altitude to a
point about half-way down, where they are
2,700 feet, and then decrease to 1,300 feet at
the foot. Narrow Cañon is nine and a half
miles long, with walls 1,300 feet in height at
the head, and coming down to the water at
the foot.</p>

<p>There is very little vegetation in this
cañon, or in the adjacent country. Just at
the junction of the Grand and Green, there
are a number of hackberry trees; and along
the entire length of Cataract Cañon, the
high-water line is marked by scattered trees
of the same species. A few nut-pines and
cedars are found, and occasionally a red-bud
or judas tree; but the general aspect of the
cañons, and of the adjacent country, is that
of naked rock.</p>

<p>The distance through Glen Cañon is 149
miles. Its walls vary from two or three hundred
to sixteen hundred feet. Marble<span class="pagenum">[197]</span>
Cañon is <span class="nowrap">65 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span> miles long. At its head, it is
200 feet deep, and steadily increases in depth
to its foot, where its walls are 3,500 feet
high.</p>

<p class="dropcap">August 13.—We are now ready
to start on our way down the
Great Unknown. Our boats, tied
to a common stake, are chafing each other,
as they are tossed by the fretful river.
They ride high and buoyant, for their loads
are lighter than we could desire. We have
but a month’s rations remaining. The flour
has been resifted through the mosquito net
sieve; the spoiled bacon has been dried, and
the worst of it boiled; the few pounds of
dried apples have been spread in the sun, and
reshrunken to their normal bulk; the sugar
has all melted, and gone on its way down the
river; but we have a large sack of coffee.
The lighting of the boats has this advantage:
they will ride the waves better, and we shall<span class="pagenum">[199]</span>
have but little to carry when we make a portage.</p>

<p>We are three-quarters of a mile in the
depths of the earth, and the great river
shrinks into insignificance, as it dashes its
angry waves against the walls and cliffs, that
rise to the world above; they are but puny
ripples, and we but pigmies, running up and
down the sands, or lost among the boulders.</p>

<p>We have an unknown distance yet to run;
an unknown river yet to explore. What
falls there are, we know not; what rocks beset
the channel, we know not; what walls rise
over the river, we know not. Ah, well! we
may conjecture many things. The men talk
as cheerfully as ever; jests are bandied about
freely this morning; but to me the cheer is
somber and the jests are ghastly.</p>

<p>With some eagerness, and some anxiety,
and some misgiving, we enter the cañon below,
and are carried along by the swift water
through walls which rise from its very edge.
They have the same structure as we noticed
yesterday—tiers of irregular shelves below,<span class="pagenum">[200]</span>
and, above these, steep slopes to the foot of
marble cliffs. We run six miles in a little
more than half an hour, and emerge into a
more open portion of the cañon, where high
hills and ledges of rock intervene between
the river and the distant walls. Just at the
head of this open place the river runs across
a dike; that is, a fissure in the rocks, open to
depths below, has been filled with eruptive
matter, and this, on cooling, was harder than
the rocks through which the crevice was
made, and, when these were washed away,
the harder volcanic matter remained as a
wall, and the river has cut a gate-way
through it several hundred feet high, and as
many wide. As it crosses the wall, there is
a fall below, and a bad rapid, filled with
boulders of trap; so we stop to make a portage.
Then on we go, gliding by hills and
ledges, with distant walls in view; sweeping
past sharp angles of rock; stopping at a few
points to examine rapids, which we find can
be run, until we have made another five miles,
when we land for dinner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[201]</span></p>

<p>Then we let down with lines, over a long
rapid, and start again. Once more the walls
close in, and we find ourselves in a narrow
gorge, the water again filling the channel,
and very swift. With great care, and constant
watchfulness, we proceed, making
about four miles this afternoon, and camp in
a cave.</p>

<p><em>August 14.</em>—At daybreak we walk down
the bank of the river, on a little sandy beach,
to take a view of a new feature in the cañon.
Heretofore, hard rocks have given us bad
river; soft rocks, smooth water; and a series
of rocks harder than any we have experienced
sets in. The river enters the granite!<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>We can see but a little way into the granite
gorge, but it looks threatening.</p>

<p>After breakfast we enter on the waves.
At the very introduction, it inspires awe.
The cañon is narrower than we have ever
before seen it; the water is swifter; there are<span class="pagenum">[202]</span>
but few broken rocks in the channel; but the
walls are set, on either side, with pinnacles
and crags; and sharp, angular buttresses,
bristling with wind and wave polished spires,
extend far out into the river.</p>

<p>Ledges of rocks jut into the stream, their
tops sometimes just below the surface, sometimes
rising few or many feet above; and
island ledges, and island pinnacles, and
island towers break the swift course of the
stream into chutes, and eddies, and whirlpools.
We soon reach a place where a creek
comes in from the left, and just below, the
channel is choked with boulders, which have
washed down this lateral cañon and formed
a dam, over which there is a fall of thirty or
forty feet; but on the boulders we can get
foothold, and we make a portage.</p>

<p>Three more such dams are found. Over
one we make a portage; at the other two we
find chutes, through which we can run.</p>

<p>As we proceed, the granite rises higher,
until nearly a thousand feet of the lower part
of the walls are composed of this rock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[203]</span></p>

<p>About eleven o’clock we hear a great roar
ahead, and approach it very cautiously.
The sound grows louder and louder as we
run, and at last we find ourselves above a
long, broken fall, with ledges and pinnacles
of rock obstructing the river. There is a
descent of, perhaps, seventy-five or eighty
feet in a third of a mile, and the rushing
waters break into great waves on the
rocks, and lash themselves into a mad,
white foam. We can land just above, but
there is no foot-hold on either side by
which we can make a portage. It is nearly
a thousand feet to the top of the granite, so
it will be impossible to carry our boats
around, though we can climb to the summit
up a side gulch, and, passing along a mile or
two, can descend to the river. This we find
on examination; but such a portage would
be impracticable for us, and we must run the
rapid, or abandon the river. There is no
hesitation. We step into our boats, push off
and away we go, first on smooth but swift
water, then we strike a glassy wave, and ride<span class="pagenum">[204]</span>
to its top, down again into the trough, up
again on a higher wave, and down and up
on waves higher and still higher, until we
strike one just as it curls back, and a breaker
rolls over our little boat. Still, on we speed,
shooting past projecting rocks, till the little
boat is caught in a whirlpool, and spun
around several times. At last we pull out
again into the stream, and now the other
boats have passed us. The open compartment
of the <em>Emma Dean</em> is filled with water,
and every breaker rolls over us. Hurled
back from a rock, now on this side, now on
that, we are carried into an eddy, in which we
struggle for a few minutes, and are then out
again, the breakers still rolling over us. Our
boat is unmanageable, but she cannot sink,
and we drift down another hundred yards,
through breakers; how, we scarcely know.
We find the other boats have turned into an
eddy at the foot of the fall, and are waiting
to catch us as we come, for the men have seen
that our boat is swamped. They push out
as we come near, and pull us in against the<span class="pagenum">[205]</span>
wall. We bail our boat, and on we go again.</p>

<p>The walls, now, are more than a mile in
height—a vertical distance difficult to appreciate.
Stand on the south steps of the
Treasury building in Washington, and look
down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol
Park, and measure this distance overhead,
and imagine cliffs to extend to that altitude,
and you will understand what I mean; or,
stand at Canal Street, in New York, and
look up Broadway to Grace Church, and you
have about the distance; or, stand at Lake
Street bridge, in Chicago, and look down
to the Central Depot, and you have it again.</p>

<p>A thousand feet of this is up through granite
crags, then steep slopes and perpendicular
cliffs rise, one above another, to the summit.
The gorge is black and narrow below,
red and gray and flaring above, with crags
and angular projections on the walls, which,
cut in many places by side cañons, seem to
be a vast wilderness of rocks. Down in
these grand, gloomy depths we glide, ever
listening, for the mad waters keep up their<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>
roar; ever watching, ever peering ahead, for
the narrow cañon is winding, and the river is
closed in so that we can see but a few hundred
yards, and what there may be below we
know not; but we listen for falls, and watch
for rocks, or stop now and then, in the bay
of a recess, to admire the gigantic scenery.
And ever, as we go, there is some new pinnacle
or tower, some crag or peak, some distant
view of the upper plateau, some strange
shaped rock, or some deep, narrow side
cañon. Then we come to another broken
fall, which appears more difficult than the
one we ran this morning.</p>

<p>A small creek comes in on the right, and
the first fall of the water is over boulders,
which have been carried down by this lateral
stream. We land at its mouth, and stop for
an hour or two to examine the fall. It seems
possible to let down with lines, at least a
part of the way, from point to point, along
the right hand wall. So we make a portage
over the first rocks, and find footing on some
boulders below. Then we let down one of<span class="pagenum">[207]</span>
the boats to the end of her line, when she
reaches a corner of the projecting rock, to
which one of the men clings, and steadies
her, while I examine an eddy below. I think
we can pass the other boats down by us, and
catch them in the eddy. This is soon done
and the men in the boats in the eddy pull us
to their side. On the shore of this little eddy
there is about two feet of gravel beach above
the water. Standing on this beach, some of
the men take the line of the little boat and
let it drift down against another projecting
angle. Here is a little shelf, on which a man
from my boat climbs, and a shorter line is
passed to him, and he fastens the boat to the
side of the cliff. Then the second one is let
down, bringing the line of the third. When
the second boat is tied up, the two men standing
on the beach above spring into the last
boat, which is pulled up alongside of ours.
Then we let down the boats, for twenty-five
or thirty yards, by walking along the shelf,
landing them again in the mouth of a side
cañon. Just below this there is another pile<span class="pagenum">[208]</span>
of boulders, over which we make another
portage. From the foot of these rocks we
can climb to another shelf, forty or fifty feet
above the water.</p>

<p>On this beach we camp for the night. We
find a few sticks, which have lodged in the
rocks. It is raining hard, and we have no
shelter, but kindle a fire and have our supper.
We sit on the rocks all night, wrapped
in our ponchos, getting what sleep we can.</p>

<p><em>August 15.</em>—This morning we find we can
let down for three or four hundred yards,
and it is managed in this way: We pass
along the wall, by climbing from projecting
point to point, sometimes near the water’s
edge, at other places fifty or sixty feet above,
and hold the boat with a line, while two men
remain aboard, and prevent her from being
dashed against the rocks, and keep the line
from getting caught on the wall. In two
hours we have brought them all down, as far
as it is possible, in this way. A few yards
below, the river strikes with great violence
against a projecting rock, and our boats are<span class="pagenum">[209]</span>
pulled up in a little bay above. We must
now manage to pull out of this, and clear the
point below. The little boat is held by the
bow obliquely up the stream. We jump in,
and pull out only a few strokes, and sweep
clear of the dangerous rock. The other
boats follow in the same manner, and the
rapid is passed.</p>

<p>It is not easy to describe the labor of such
navigation. We must prevent the waves
from dashing the boats against the cliffs.
Sometimes, where the river is swift, we must
put a bight of rope about a rock, to prevent
her being snatched from us by a wave; but
where the plunge is too great, or the chute
too swift, we must let her leap, and catch her
below, or the undertow will drag her under
the falling water, and she sinks. Where we
wish to run her out a little way from shore,
through a channel between rocks, we first
throw in little sticks of drift wood, and watch
their course, to see where we must steer, so
that she will pass the channel in safety. And
so we hold, and let go, and pull, and lift, and<span class="pagenum">[210]</span>
ward, among rocks, around rocks, and over
rocks.</p>

<p>And now we go on through this solemn,
mysterious way. The river is very deep, the
cañon very narrow, and still obstructed, so
that there is no steady flow of the stream;
but the waters wheel, and roll, and boil, and
we are scarcely able to determine where we
can go. Now, the boat is carried to the
right, perhaps close to the wall; again, she
is shot into the stream, and perhaps is
dragged over to the other side, where, caught
in a whirlpool, she spins about. We can
neither land nor run as we please. The
boats are entirely unmanageable; no order
in their running can be preserved; now one,
now another, is ahead, each crew laboring for
its own preservation. In such a place we
come to another rapid. Two of the boats
run it perforce. One succeeds in landing,
but there is no foot-hold by which to make
a portage, and she is pushed out again into
the stream. The next minute a great reflex
wave fills the open compartment; she is<span class="pagenum">[211]</span>
water-logged, and drifts unmanageable.
Breaker after breaker rolls over her, and one
capsizes her. The men are thrown out; but
they cling to the boat, and she drifts down
some distance, alongside of us, and we are
able to catch her. She is soon bailed out,
and the men are aboard once more; but the
oars are lost, so a pair from the <em>Emma Dean</em>
is spared. Then for two miles we find
smooth water.</p>

<p>Clouds are playing in the cañon to-day.
Sometimes they roll down in great masses,
filling the gorge with gloom; sometimes they
hang above, from wall to wall, and cover the
cañon with a roof of impending storm; and
we can peer long distances up and down this
cañon corridor, with its cloud roof overhead,
its walls of black granite, and its river bright
with the sheen of broken waters. Then, a
gust of wind sweeps down a side gulch, and,
making a rift in the clouds, reveals the blue
heavens, and a stream of sunlight pours in.
Then, the clouds drift away into the distance,
and hang around crags, and peaks,<span class="pagenum">[212]</span>
and pinnacles, and towers, and walls, and
cover them with a mantle, that lifts from
time to time, and sets them all in sharp relief.
Then, baby clouds creep out of side
cañons, glide around points, and creep back
again, into more distant gorges. Then,
clouds, set in strata, across the cañon, with
intervening vista views, to cliffs and rocks
beyond. The clouds are children of the
heavens, and when they play among the
rocks, they lift them to the region above.</p>

<p>It rains! Rapidly little rills are formed
above, and these soon grow into brooks, and
the brooks grow into creeks, and tumble over
the walls in innumerable cascades, adding
their wild music to the roar of the river.
When the rain ceases, the rills, brooks, and
creeks run dry. The waters that fall, during
a rain, on these steep rocks, are gathered
at once into the river; they could scarcely be
poured in more suddenly, if some vast spout
ran from the clouds to the stream itself.
When a storm bursts over the cañon, a side
gulch is dangerous, for a sudden flood may<span class="pagenum">[213]</span>
come, and the inpouring waters will raise the
river, so as to hide the rocks before your
eyes.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon, we discover a
stream, entering from the north, a clear,
beautiful creek, coming down through a gorgeous
red cañon. We land, and camp on
a sand beach, above its mouth, under a great,
overspreading tree, with willow shaped
leaves.</p>

<p><em>August 16.</em>—We must dry our rations
again to-day, and make oars.</p>

<p>The Colorado is never a clear stream, but
for the past three or four days it has been
raining much of the time, and the floods,
which are poured over the walls, have
brought down great quantities of mud, making
it exceedingly turbid now. The little
affluent, which we have discovered here, is a
clear, beautiful creek, or river, as it would
be termed in this western country, where
streams are not abundant. We have named
one stream, away above, in honor of the
great chief of the “Bad Angels,” and, as this<span class="pagenum">[214]</span>
is in beautiful contrast to that, we conclude
to name it “Bright Angel.”</p>

<p>Early in the morning, the whole party
starts up to explore the Bright Angel River,
with the special purpose of seeking timber,
from which to make oars. A couple of
miles above, we find a large pine log, which
has been floated down from the plateau,
probably from an altitude of more than six
thousand feet, but not many miles back. On
its way, it must have passed over many cataracts
and falls, for it bears scars in evidence
of the rough usage which it has received.
The men roll it on skids, and the work of
sawing oars is commenced.</p>

<p>This stream heads away back, under a line
of abrupt cliffs, that terminates the plateau,
and tumbles down more than four thousand
feet in the first mile or two of its course; then
runs through a deep, narrow cañon, until it
reaches the river.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon I return, and go up
a little gulch, just above this creek, about
two hundred yards from camp, and discover<span class="pagenum">[215]</span>
the ruins of two or three old houses, which
were originally of stone, laid in mortar.
Only the foundations are left, but irregular
blocks, of which the houses were constructed,
lie scattered about. In one room I find an
old mealing stone, deeply worn, as if it had
been much used. A great deal of pottery
is strewn around, and old trails, which in
some places are deeply worn into the rocks,
are seen.</p>

<p>It is ever a source of wonder to us why
these ancient people sought such inaccessible
places for their homes. They were, doubtless,
an agricultural race, but there are no
lands here, of any considerable extent, that
they could have cultivated. To the west of
Oraiby, one of the towns in the “Province
of Tusayan,” in Northern Arizona, the inhabitants
have actually built little terraces
along the face of the cliff, where a spring
gushes out, and thus made their sites for
gardens. It is possible that the ancient inhabitants
of this place made their agricultural
lands in the same way. But why should<span class="pagenum">[216]</span>
they seek such spots? Surely, the country
was not so crowded with population as to
demand the utilization of so barren a region.
The only solution of the problem suggested
is this: We know that, for a century or two
after the settlement of Mexico, many expeditions
were sent into the country now comprised
in Arizona and New Mexico, for the
purpose of bringing the town building people
under the dominion of the Spanish government.
Many of their villages were destroyed,
and the inhabitants fled to regions
at that time unknown; and there are traditions,
among the people who inhabit the
<i lang="es">pueblos</i> that still remain, that the cañons
were these unknown lands. Maybe these
buildings were erected at that time; sure it is
that they have a much more modern appearance
than the ruins scattered over Nevada,
Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico.
Those old Spanish conquerors had a monstrous
greed for gold, and a wonderful lust
for saving souls. Treasures they must have;
if not on earth, why, then, in heaven; and<span class="pagenum">[217]</span>
when they failed to find heathen temples, bedecked
with silver, they propitiated Heaven
by seizing the heathen themselves. There is
yet extant a copy of a record, made by a
heathen artist, to express his conception of
the demands of the conquerors. In one part
of the picture we have a lake, and near by
stands a priest pouring water on the head of
a native. On the other side, a poor Indian
has a cord about his throat. Lines run from
these two groups, to a central figure, a man
with beard, and full Spanish panoply. The
interpretation of the picture writing is this:
“Be baptized, as this saved heathen; or be
hanged, as that damned heathen.” Doubtless,
some of these people preferred a third
alternative, and, rather than be baptized or
hanged, they chose to be imprisoned within
these cañon walls.</p>

<p><em>August 17.</em>—Our rations are still spoiling;
the bacon is so badly injured that we are
compelled to throw it away. By an accident,
this morning, the saleratus is lost overboard.
We have now only musty flour<span class="pagenum">[218]</span>
sufficient for ten days, a few dried apples,
but plenty of coffee. We must make all
haste possible. If we meet with difficulties,
as we have done in the cañon above, we may
be compelled to give up the expedition, and
try to reach the Mormon settlements to the
north. Our hopes are that the worst places
are passed, but our barometers are all so
much injured as to be useless, so we have
lost our reckoning in altitude, and know not
how much descent the river has yet to make.</p>

<p>The stream is still wild and rapid, and
rolls through a narrow channel. We make
but slow progress, often landing against a
wall, and climbing around some point, where
we can see the river below. Although very
anxious to advance, we are determined to
run with great caution, lest, by another accident,
we lose all our supplies. How precious
that little flour has become! We divide
it among the boats, and carefully store
it away, so that it can be lost only by the loss
of the boat itself.</p>

<p>We make ten miles and a half, and camp<span class="pagenum">[219]</span>
among the rocks, on the right. We have
had rain, from time to time, all day, and
have been thoroughly drenched and chilled;
but between showers the sun shines with
great power, and the mercury in our thermometers
stands at 115°, so that we have
rapid changes from great extremes, which
are very disagreeable. It is especially cold
in the rain to-night. The little canvas we
have is rotten and useless; the rubber ponchos,
with which we started from Green
River City, have all been lost; more than half
the party is without hats, and not one of us
has an entire suit of clothes, and we have
not a blanket apiece. So we gather drift
wood, and build a fire; but after supper the
rain, coming down in torrents, extinguishes
it, and we sit up all night, on the rocks, shivering,
and are more exhausted by the night’s
discomfort than by the day’s toil.</p>

<p><em>August 18.</em>—The day is employed in making
portages, and we advance but two miles
on our journey. Still it rains.</p>

<p>While the men are at work making portages,<span class="pagenum">[220]</span>
I climb up the granite to its summit,
and go away back over the rust colored sandstones
and greenish yellow shales, to the foot
of the marble wall. I climb so high that the
men and boats are lost in the black depths
below, and the dashing river is a rippling
brook; and still there is more cañon above
than below. All about me are interesting
geological records. The book is open, and
I can read as I run. All about me are grand
views, for the clouds are playing again in
the gorges. But somehow I think of the
nine days’ rations, and the bad river, and the
lesson of the rocks, and the glory of the scene
is but half seen.</p>

<p>I push on to an angle, where I hope to get
a view of the country beyond, to see, if possible,
what the prospect may be of our soon
running through this plateau, or, at least, of
meeting with some geological change that
will let us out of the granite; but, arriving
at the point, I can see below only a labyrinth
of deep gorges.</p>

<p><em>August 19.</em>—Rain again this morning.<span class="pagenum">[221]</span>
Still we are in our granite prison, and the
time is occupied until noon in making a long,
bad portage.</p>

<p>After dinner, in running a rapid, the
pioneer boat is upset by a wave. We are
some distance in advance of the larger boats,
the river is rough and swift, and we are unable
to land, but cling to the boat, and are
carried down stream, over another rapid.
The men in the boats above see our trouble,
but they are caught in whirlpools, and are
spinning about in eddies, and it seems a long
time before they come to our relief. At last
they do come; our boat is turned right side
up, bailed out; the oars, which fortunately
have floated along in company with us, are
gathered up, and on we go, without even
landing.</p>

<p>Soon after the accident the clouds break
away, and we have sunshine again.</p>

<p>Soon we find a little beach, with just room
enough to land. Here we camp, but there
is no wood. Across the river, and a little
way above, we see some drift wood lodged<span class="pagenum">[222]</span>
in the rocks. So we bring two boat loads
over, build a huge fire, and spread everything
to dry. It is the first cheerful night we have
had for a week; a warm, drying fire in the
midst of the camp, and a few bright stars in
our patch of heavens overhead.</p>

<p><em>August 20.</em>—The characteristics of the
cañon change this morning. The river is
broader, the walls more sloping, and composed
of black slates, that stand on edge.
These nearly vertical slates are washed out
in places—that is, the softer beds are washed
out between the harder, which are left standing.
In this way, curious little alcoves are
formed, in which are quiet bays of water,
but on a much smaller scale than the great
bays and buttresses of Marble Cañon.</p>

<p>The river is still rapid, and we stop to let
down with lines several times, but make
greater progress as we run ten miles. We
camp on the right bank. Here, on a terrace
of trap, we discover another group of
ruins. There was evidently quite a village
on this rock. Again we find mealing stones,<span class="pagenum">[223]</span>
and much broken pottery, and up in a little
natural shelf in the rock, back of the ruins,
we find a globular basket, that would hold
perhaps a third of a bushel. It is badly
broken, and, as I attempt to take it up, it
falls to pieces. There are many beautiful
flint chips, as if this had been the home of
an old arrow maker.</p>

<p><em>August 21.</em>—We start early this morning,
cheered by the prospect of a fine day, and
encouraged, also, by the good run made yesterday.
A quarter of a mile below camp
the river turns abruptly to the left, and between
camp and that point is very swift, running
down in a long, broken chute, and piling
up against the foot of the cliff, where it turns
to the left. We try to pull across, so as to
go down on the other side, but the waters are
swift, and it seems impossible for us to escape
the rock below; but, in pulling across,
the bow of the boat is turned to the farther
shore, so that we are swept broadside down,
and are prevented, by the rebounding waters,
from striking against the wall. There we<span class="pagenum">[224]</span>
toss about for a few seconds in these billows,
and are carried past the danger. Below, the
river turns again to the right, the cañon is
very narrow, and we see in advance but a
short distance. The water, too, is very
swift, and there is no landing place. From
around this curve there comes a mad roar,
and down we are carried, with a dizzying
velocity, to the head of another rapid. On
either side, high over our heads, there are
overhanging granite walls, and the sharp
bends cut off our view, so that a few minutes
will carry us into unknown waters. Away
we go, on one long, winding chute. I stand
on deck, supporting myself with a strap, fastened
on either side to the gunwale, and the
boat glides rapidly, where the water is
smooth, or, striking a wave, she leaps and
bounds like a thing of life, and we have a
wild, exhilarating ride for ten miles, which
we make in less than an hour. The excitement
is so great that we forget the danger,
until we hear the roar of the great fall below;
then we back on our oars, and are carried<span class="pagenum">[225]</span>
slowly toward its head, and succeed in
landing just above, and find that we have to
make another portage. At this we are engaged
until some time after dinner.</p>

<p>Just here we run out of the granite!</p>

<p>Ten miles in less than half a day, and limestone
walls below. Good cheer returns; we
forget the storms, and the gloom, and cloud
covered cañons, and the black granite, and
the raging river, and push our boats from
shore in great glee.</p>

<p>Though we are out of the granite, the river
is still swift, and we wheel about a point
again to the right, and turn, so as to head
back in the direction from which we came,
and see the granite again, with its narrow
gorge and black crags; but we meet with
no more great falls, or rapids. Still, we run
cautiously, and stop, from time to time, to
examine some places which look bad. Yet,
we make ten miles this afternoon; twenty
miles, in all, to-day.</p>

<p><em>August 22.</em>—We come to rapids again,
this morning, and are occupied several hours<span class="pagenum">[226]</span>
in passing them, letting the boats down, from
rock to rock, with lines, for nearly half a
mile, and then have to make a long portage.
While the men are engaged in this, I climb
the wall on the northeast, to a height of about
two thousand five hundred feet, where I can
obtain a good view of a long stretch of cañon
below. Its course is to the southwest. The
walls seem to rise very abruptly, for two
thousand five hundred or three thousand feet,
and then there is a gently sloping terrace,
on each side, for two or three miles, and again
we find cliffs, one thousand five hundred or
two thousand feet high. From the brink of
these the plateau stretches back to the north
and south, for a long distance. Away down
the cañon, on the right wall, I can see a
group of mountains, some of which appear
to stand on the brink of the cañon. The effect
of the terrace is to give the appearance
of a narrow winding valley, with high walls
on either side, and a deep, dark, meandering
gorge down its middle. It is impossible,
from this point of view, to determine whether<span class="pagenum">[227]</span>
we have granite at the bottom, or not; but,
from geological considerations, I conclude
that we shall have marble walls below.</p>

<p>After my return to the boats, we run another
mile, and camp for the night.</p>

<p>We have made but little over seven miles
to-day, and a part of our flour has been
soaked in the river again.</p>

<p><em>August 23.</em>—Our way to-day is again
through marble walls. Now and then we
pass, for a short distance, through patches
of granite, like hills thrust up into the limestone.
At one of these places we have to
make another portage, and, taking advantage
of the delay, I go up a little stream, to
the north, wading it all the way, sometimes
having to plunge in to my neck; in other
places being compelled to swim across little
basins that have been excavated at the foot
of the falls. Along its course are many cascades
and springs gushing out from the rocks
on either side. Sometimes a cottonwood
tree grows over the water. I come to one
beautiful fall, of more than a hundred and<span class="pagenum">[228]</span>
fifty feet, and climb around it to the right,
on the broken rocks. Still going up, I find
the cañon narrowing very much, being but
fifteen or twenty feet wide; yet the walls
rise on either side many hundreds of feet,
perhaps thousands; I can hardly tell.</p>

<p>In some places the stream has not excavated
its channel down vertically through the
rocks, but has cut obliquely, so that one wall
overhangs the other. In other places it is
cut vertically above and obliquely below, or
obliquely above and vertically below, so that
it is impossible to see out overhead. But I
can go no farther. The time which I estimated
it would take to make the portage has
almost expired, and I start back on a round
trot, wading in the creek where I must, and
plunging through basins, and find the men
waiting for me, and away we go on the river.</p>

<p>Just after dinner we pass a stream on the
right, which leaps into the Colorado by a direct
fall of more than a hundred feet, forming
a beautiful cascade. There is a bed of
very hard rock above, thirty or forty feet in<span class="pagenum">[229]</span>
thickness, and much softer beds below. The
hard beds above project many yards beyond
the softer, which are washed out, forming a
deep cave behind the fall, and the stream
pours through a narrow crevice above into
a deep pool below. Around on the rocks,
in the cave like chamber, are set beautiful
ferns, with delicate fronds and enameled
stalks. The little frondlets have their points
turned down, to form spore cases. It has
very much the appearance of the Maiden’s
hair fern, but is much larger. This delicate
foliage covers the rocks all about the fountain,
and gives the chamber great beauty.
But we have little time to spend in admiration,
so on we go.</p>

<p>We make fine progress this afternoon,
carried along by a swift river, and shoot
over the rapids, finding no serious obstructions.</p>

<p>The cañon walls, for two thousand five
hundred or three thousand feet, are very regular,
rising almost perpendicularly, but here
and there set with narrow steps, and occasionally<span class="pagenum">[230]</span>
we can see away above the broad terrace,
to distant cliffs.</p>

<p>We camp to-night in a marble cave, and
find, on looking at our reckoning, we have
run twenty-two miles.</p>

<p><em>August 24.</em>—The cañon is wider to-day.
The walls rise to a vertical height of nearly
three thousand feet. In many places the
river runs under a cliff, in great curves, forming
amphitheaters, half dome shaped.</p>

<p>Though the river is rapid, we meet with
no serious obstructions, and run twenty
miles. It is curious how anxious we are to
make up our reckoning every time we stop,
now that our diet is confined to plenty of
coffee, very little spoiled flour, and very few
dried apples. It has come to be a race for
a dinner. Still, we make such fine progress,
all hands are in good cheer, but not a moment
of daylight is lost.</p>

<p><em>August 25.</em>—We make twelve miles this
morning, when we come to monuments of
lava, standing in the river; low rocks, mostly,
but some of them shafts more than a hundred<span class="pagenum">[231]</span>
feet high. Going on down, three or four
miles, we find them increasing in number.
Great quantities of cooled lava and many
cinder cones are seen on either side; and then
we come to an abrupt cataract. Just over
the fall, on the right wall, a cinder cone, or
extinct volcano, with a well defined crater,
stands on the very brink of the cañon. This,
doubtless, is the one we saw two or three
days ago. From this volcano vast floods of
lava have been poured down into the river,
and a stream of the molten rock has run up
the cañon, three or four miles, and down, we
know not how far. Just where it poured
over the cañon wall is the fall. The whole
north side, as far as we can see, is lined with
the black basalt, and high up on the opposite
wall are patches of the same material,
resting on the benches, and filling old alcoves
and caves, giving to the wall a spotted
appearance.</p>

<p>The rocks are broken in two, along a line
which here crosses the river, and the beds,
which we have seen coming down the cañon<span class="pagenum">[232]</span>
for the last thirty miles, have dropped 800
feet, on the lower side of the line, forming
what geologists call a fault. The volcanic
cone stands directly over the fissure thus
formed. On the side of the river opposite,
mammoth springs burst out of this crevice,
one or two hundred feet above the river,
pouring in a stream quite equal in volume to
the Colorado Chiquito.</p>

<p>This stream seems to be loaded with carbonate
of lime, and the water, evaporating,
leaves an incrustation on the rocks; and this
process has been continued for a long time,
for extensive deposits are noticed, in which
are basins, with bubbling springs. The water
is salty.</p>

<p>We have to make a portage here, which is
completed in about three hours, and on we
go.</p>

<p>We have no difficulty as we float along,
and I am able to observe the wonderful phenomena
connected with this flood of lava.
The cañon was doubtless filled to a height
of twelve or fifteen hundred feet, perhaps<span class="pagenum">[233]</span>
by more than one flood. This would dam
the water back; and in cutting through this
great lava bed, a new channel has been
formed, sometimes on one side, sometimes
on the other. The cooled lava, being of
firmer texture than the rocks of which the
walls are composed, remains in some places;
in others a narrow channel has been cut, leaving
a line of basalt on either side. It is possible
that the lava cooled faster on the sides
against the walls, and that the center ran
out; but of this we can only conjecture.
There are other places, where almost the
whole of the lava is gone, patches of it only
being seen where it has caught on the walls.
As we float down, we can see that it ran out
into side cañons. In some places this basalt
has a fine, columnar structure, often in concentric
prisms, and masses of these concentric
columns have coalesced. In some places,
when the flow occurred, the cañon was probably
at about the same depth as it is now,
for we can see where the basalt has rolled out
on the sands, and, what seems curious to me,<span class="pagenum">[234]</span>
the sands are not melted or metamorphosed
to any appreciable extent. In places the
bed of the river is of sandstone or limestone,
in other places of lava, showing that it has
all been cut out again where the sandstones
and limestones appear; but there is a little
yet left where the bed is of lava.</p>

<p>What a conflict of water and fire there
must have been here! Just imagine a river
of molten rock, running down into a river of
melted snow. What a seething and boiling
of the waters; what clouds of steam rolled
into the heavens!</p>

<p>Thirty-five miles to-day. Hurrah!</p>

<p><em>August 26.</em>—The cañon walls are steadily
becoming higher as we advance. They are
still bold, and nearly vertical up to the terrace.
We still see evidence of the eruption
discovered yesterday, but the thickness of the
basalt is decreasing, as we go down the
stream; yet it has been reinforced at points
by streams that have come down from volcanoes
standing on the terrace above, but<span class="pagenum">[235]</span>
which we cannot see from the river below.</p>

<p>Since we left the Colorado Chiquito, we
have seen no evidences that the tribe of Indians
inhabiting the plateaus on either side
ever come down to the river; but about
eleven o’clock to-day we discover an Indian
garden, at the foot of the wall on the right,
just where a little stream, with a narrow
flood plain, comes down through a side cañon.
Along the valley, the Indians have planted
corn, using the water which burst out in
springs at the foot of the cliff, for irrigation.
The corn is looking quite well, but is not sufficiently
advanced to give us roasting ears;
but there are some nice, green squashes. We
carry ten or a dozen of these on board our
boats, and hurriedly leave, not willing to be
caught in the robbery, yet excusing ourselves
by pleading our great want. We run down
a short distance, to where we feel certain no
Indians can follow; and what a kettle of
squash sauce we make! True, we have no
salt with which to season it, but it makes a<span class="pagenum">[236]</span>
fine addition to our unleavened bread and
coffee. Never was fruit so sweet as these
stolen squashes.</p>

<p>After dinner we push on again, making
fine time, finding many rapids, but none so
bad that we cannot run them with safety,
and when we stop, just at dusk, and foot up
our reckoning, we find we have run thirty-five
miles again.</p>

<p>What a supper we make; unleavened
bread, green squash sauce, and strong coffee.
We have been for a few days on half
rations, but we have no stint of roast squash.</p>

<p>A few days like this, and we shall be out
of prison.</p>

<p><em>August 27.</em>—This morning the river takes
a more southerly direction. The dip of the
rocks is to the north, and we are rapidly running
into lower formations. Unless our
course changes, we shall very soon run again
into the granite. This gives us some anxiety.
Now and then the river turns to the
west, and excites hopes that are soon destroyed
by another turn to the south. About<span class="pagenum">[237]</span>
nine o’clock we come to the dreaded rock.
It is with no little misgiving that we see the
river enter these black, hard walls. At its
very entrance we have to make a portage;
then we have to let down with lines past some
ugly rocks. Then we run a mile or two
farther, and then the rapids below can be
seen.</p>

<p>About eleven o’clock we come to a place
in the river where it seems much worse than
any we have yet met in all its course. A little
creek comes down from the left. We
land first on the right, and clamber up over
the granite pinnacles for a mile or two, but
can see no way by which we can let down,
and to run it would be sure destruction.
After dinner we cross to examine it on the
left. High above the river we can walk along
on the top of the granite, which is broken off
at the edge, and set with crags and pinnacles,
so that it is very difficult to get a view of the
river at all. In my eagerness to reach a
point where I can see the roaring fall below,
I go too far on the wall, and can neither advance<span class="pagenum">[238]</span>
nor retreat. I stand with one foot on
a little projecting rock, and cling with my
hand fixed in a little crevice. Finding I am
caught here, suspended 400 feet above the
river, into which I should fall if my footing
fails, I call for help. The men come, and
pass me a line, but I cannot let go of the
rock long enough to take hold of it.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Then
they bring two or three of the largest oars.
All this takes time which seems very precious
to me; but at last they arrive. The blade of
one of the oars is pushed into a little crevice
in the rock beyond me, in such a manner that
they can hold me pressed against the wall.
Then another is fixed in such a way that I
can step on it, and thus I am extricated.</p>

<p>Still another hour is spent in examining
the river from this side, but no good view of
it is obtained, so now we return to the side
that was first examined, and the afternoon is
spent in clambering among the crags and
pinnacles, and carefully scanning the river<span class="pagenum">[239]</span>
again. We find that the lateral streams
have washed boulders into the river, so as to
form a dam, over which the water makes a
broken fall of eighteen or twenty feet; then
there is a rapid, beset with rocks, for two or
three hundred yards, while, on the other side,
points of the wall project into the river.
Then there is a second fall below; how great,
we cannot tell. Then there is a rapid, filled
with huge rocks, for one or two hundred
yards. At the bottom of it, from the right
wall, a great rock projects quite half way
across the river. It has a sloping surface
extending up stream, and the water, coming
down with all the momentum gained in the
falls and rapids above, rolls up this inclined
plane many feet, and tumbles over to the left.
I decide that it is possible to let down over
the first fall, then run near the right cliff to
a point just above the second, where we can
pull out into a little chute, and, having run
over that in safety, we must pull with all our
power across the stream, to avoid the great
rock below. On my return to the boat, I<span class="pagenum">[240]</span>
announce to the men that we are to run it
in the morning. Then we cross the river,
and go into camp for the night on some
rocks, in the mouth of the little cañon.</p>

<p>After supper Captain Howland asks to
have a talk with me. We walk up the little
creek a short distance, and I soon find that
his object is to remonstrate against my determination
to proceed. He thinks that we
had better abandon the river here. Talking
with him, I learn that his brother, William
Dunn, and himself have determined to go
no farther in the boats. So we return to
camp. Nothing is said to the other men.</p>

<p>For the last two days, our course has not
been plotted. I sit down and do this now,
for the purpose of finding where we are by
dead reckoning. It is a clear night, and I
take out the sextant to make observation for
latitude, and find that the astronomic determination
agrees very nearly with that of
the plot—quite as closely as might be expected,
from a meridian observation on a
planet. In a direct line, we must be about<span class="pagenum">[241]</span>
forty-five miles from the mouth of the Rio
Virgen. If we can reach that point, we
know that there are settlements up that river
about twenty miles. This forty-five miles,
in a direct line, will probably be eighty or
ninety in the meandering line of the river.
But then we know that there is comparatively
open country for many miles above
the mouth of the Virgen, which is our point
of destination.</p>

<p>As soon as I determine all this, I spread
my plot on the sand, and wake Howland,
who is sleeping down by the river, and show
him where I suppose we are, and where several
Mormon settlements are situated.</p>

<p>We have another short talk about the morrow,
and he lies down again; but for me there
is no sleep. All night long, I pace up and
down a little path, on a few yards of sand
beach, along by the river. Is it wise to go
on? I go to the boats again, to look at our
rations. I feel satisfied that we can get over
the danger immediately before us; what
there may be below I know not. From our<span class="pagenum">[242]</span>
outlook yesterday, on the cliffs, the cañon
seemed to make another great bend to the
south, and this, from our experience heretofore,
means more and higher granite walls.
I am not sure that we can climb out of the
cañon here, and, when at the top of the wall,
I know enough of the country to be certain
that it is a desert of rock and sand, between
this and the nearest Mormon town, which, on
the most direct line, must be seventy-five
miles away. True, the late rains have been
favorable to us, should we go out, for the
probabilities are that we shall find water still
standing in holes, and, at one time, I almost
conclude to leave the river. But for years I
have been contemplating this trip. To leave
the exploration unfinished, to say that there
is a part of the cañon which I cannot explore,
having already almost accomplished it, is
more than I am willing to acknowledge, and
I determine to go on.</p>

<p>I wake my brother, and tell him of Howland’s
determination, and he promises to
stay with me; then I call up Hawkins, the<span class="pagenum">[243]</span>
cook, and he makes a like promise; then
Sumner, and Bradley, and Hall, and they
all agree to go on.</p>

<p><em>August 28.</em>—At last daylight comes, and
we have breakfast, without a word being
said about the future. The meal is as solemn
as a funeral. After breakfast, I ask
the three men if they still think it best to
leave us. The elder Howland thinks it is,
and Dunn agrees with him. The younger
Howland tries to persuade them to go on
with the party, failing in which, he decides
to go with his brother.</p>

<p>Then we cross the river. The small boat
is very much disabled, and unseaworthy.
With the loss of hands, consequent on the
departure of the three men, we shall not be
able to run all of the boats, so I decide to
leave my <em>Emma Dean</em>.</p>

<p>Two rifles and a shotgun are given to the
men who are going out. I ask them to help
themselves to the rations, and take what they
think to be a fair share. This they refuse
to do, saying they have no fear but that they<span class="pagenum">[244]</span>
can get something to eat; but Billy, the
cook, has a pan of biscuits prepared for dinner,
and these he leaves on a rock.</p>

<p>Before starting, we take our barometers,
fossils, the minerals, and some ammunition
from the boat, and leave them on the rocks.
We are going over this place as light as possible.
The three men help us lift our boats
over a rock twenty-five or thirty feet high,
and let them down again over the first fall,
and now we are all ready to start. The last
thing before leaving, I write a letter to my
wife, and give it to Howland. Sumner
gives him his watch, directing that it be sent
to his sister, should he not be heard from
again. The records of the expedition have
been kept in duplicate. One set of these is
given to Howland, and now we are ready.
For the last time, they entreat us not to go
on, and tell us that it is madness to set out
in this place; that we can never get safely
through it; and, further, that the river turns
again to the south into the granite, and a
few miles of such rapids and falls will exhaust<span class="pagenum">[245]</span>
our entire stock of rations, and then
it will be too late to climb out. Some tears
are shed; it is rather a solemn parting; each
party thinks the other is taking the dangerous
course.</p>

<p>My old boat left, I go on board of the
<em>Maid of the Cañon</em>. The three men climb a
crag, that overhangs the river, to watch us
off. The <em>Maid of the Cañon</em> pushes out.
We glide rapidly along the foot of the wall,
just grazing one great rock, then pull out a
little into the chute of the second fall, and
plunge over it. The open compartment is
filled when we strike the first wave below,
but we cut through it, and then the men pull
with all their power toward the left wall,
and swing clear of the dangerous rock below
all right. We are scarcely a minute in running
it, and find that, although it looked bad
from above, we have passed many places that
were worse.</p>

<p>The other boat follows without more difficulty.
We land at the first practicable
point below and fire our guns, as a signal<span class="pagenum">[246]</span>
to the men above that we have come over in
safety. Here we remain a couple of hours,
hoping that they will take the smaller boat
and follow us. We are behind a curve in
the cañon, and cannot see up to where we
left them, and so we wait until their coming
seems hopeless, and push on.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>And now we have a succession of rapids
and falls until noon, all of which we run in
safety. Just after dinner we come to another
bad place. A little stream comes in
from the left, and below there is a fall, and
still below another fall. Above, the river
tumbles down, over and among the rocks, in
whirlpools and great waves, and the waters
are lashed into mad, white foam. We run
along the left, above this, and soon see that
we cannot get down on this side, but it seems
possible to let down on the other. We pull
up stream again, for two or three hundred
yards, and cross. Now there is a bed of
basalt on this northern side of the cañon, with<span class="pagenum">[247]</span>
a bold escarpment, that seems to be a hundred
feet high. We can climb it, and walk
along its summit to a point where we are
just at the head of the fall. Here the basalt
is broken down again, so it seems to us, and
I direct the men to take a line to the top of
the cliff, and let the boats down along the
wall. One man remains in the boat, to keep
her clear of the rocks, and prevent her line
from being caught on the projecting angles.
I climb the cliff, and pass along to a point
just over the fall, and descend by broken
rocks, and find that the break of the fall is
above the break of the wall, so that we cannot
land; and that still below the river is
very bad, and that there is no possibility of
a portage.</p>

<p>Without waiting further to examine and
determine what shall be done, I hasten back
to the top of the cliff, to stop the boats from
coming down. When I arrive, I find the
men have let one of them down to the head
of the fall. She is in swift water, and they
are not able to pull her back; nor are they<span class="pagenum">[248]</span>
able to go on with the line, as it is not long
enough to reach the higher part of the cliff,
which is just before them; so they take a
bight around a crag. I send two men
back for the other line. The boat is in very
swift water, and Bradley is standing in the
open compartment, holding out his oar to
prevent her from striking against the foot of
the cliff. Now she shoots out into the
stream, and up as far as the line will permit,
and then, wheeling, drives headlong against
the rock, then out and back again, now
straining on the line, now striking against
the rock. As soon as the second line is
brought, we pass it down to him; but his attention
is all taken up with his own situation,
and he does not see that we are passing the
line to him. I stand on a projecting rock,
waving my hat to gain his attention, for my
voice is drowned by the roaring of the falls.</p>

<p>Just at this moment, I see him take his
knife from its sheath, and step forward to
cut the line. He has evidently decided that
it is better to go over with the boat as it is,<span class="pagenum">[249]</span>
than to wait for her to be broken to pieces.
As he leans over, the boat sheers again into
the stream, the stern-post breaks away, and
she is loose. With perfect composure Bradley
seizes the great scull oar, places it in the
stern rowlock, and pulls with all his power
(and he is an athlete) to turn the bow of
the boat down stream, for he wishes to go
bow down, rather than to drift broadside on.
One, two strokes he makes, and a third just
as she goes over, and the boat is fairly turned,
and she goes down almost beyond our sight,
though we are more than a hundred feet
above the river. Then she comes up again,
on a great wave, and down and up, then
around behind some great rocks, and is lost
in the mad, white foam below. We stand
frozen with fear, for we see no boat. Bradley
is gone, so it seems. But now, away below,
we see something coming out of the
waves. It is evidently a boat. A moment
more, and we see Bradley standing on deck,
swinging his hat to show that he is all right.
But he is in a whirlpool. We have the stempost<span class="pagenum">[250]</span>
of his boat attached to the line. How
badly she may be disabled we know not.</p>

<p>I direct Sumner and Powell to pass along
the cliff, and see if they can reach him from
below. Rhodes, Hall, and myself run to
the other boat, jump aboard, push out, and
away we go over the falls. A wave rolls
over us, and our boat is unmanageable. Another
great wave strikes us, the boat rolls
over, and tumbles and tosses, I know not
how. All I know is that Bradley is picking
us up. We soon have all right again, and
row to the cliff, and wait until Sumner and
Powell can come. After a difficult climb
they reach us. We run two or three miles
farther, and turn again to the northwest, continuing
until night, when we have run out of
the granite once more.</p>

<p><em>August 29.</em>—We start very early this
morning. The river still continues swift,
but we have no serious difficulty, and at
twelve o’clock emerge from the Grand
Cañon of the Colorado.</p>

<p>We are in a valley now, and low mountains<span class="pagenum">[251]</span>
are seen in the distance, coming to the
river below. We recognize this as the
Grand Wash.</p>

<p>A few years ago, a party of Mormons set
out from St. George, Utah, taking with them
a boat, and came down to the mouth of the
Grand Wash, where they divided, a portion
of the party crossing the river to explore the
San Francisco Mountains. Three men—Hamblin,
Miller, and Crosby—taking the
boat, went on down the river to Callville,
landing a few miles below the mouth of the
Rio Virgen. We have their manuscript
journal with us, and so the stream is comparatively
well known.</p>

<p>To-night we camp on the left bank, in a
<i lang="es">mesquite</i> thicket.</p>

<p>The relief from danger, and the joy of success,
are great. When he who has been
chained by wounds to a hospital cot, until his
canvas tent seems like a dungeon cell, until
the groans of those who lie about, tortured
with probe and knife, are piled up, a weight
of horror on his ears that he cannot throw<span class="pagenum">[252]</span>
off, cannot forget, and until the stench of
festering wounds and anæsthetic drugs has
filled the air with its loathsome burthen, at
last goes out into the open field, what a world
he sees! How beautiful the sky; how bright
the sunshine; what “floods of delirious
music” pour from the throats of birds; how
sweet the fragrance of earth, and tree, and
blossom! The first hour of convalescent
freedom seems rich recompense for all—pain,
gloom, terror.</p>

<p>Something like this are the feelings we experience
to-night. Ever before us has been
an unknown danger, heavier than immediate
peril. Every waking hour passed in the
Grand Cañon has been one of toil. We have
watched with deep solicitude the steady disappearance
of our scant supply of rations,
and from time to time have seen the river
snatch a portion of the little left, while we
were ahungered. And danger and toil were
endured in those gloomy depths, where oft-times
the clouds hid the sky by day, and but
a narrow zone of stars could be seen at night.<span class="pagenum">[253]</span>
Only during the few hours of deep sleep,
consequent on hard labor, has the roar of the
waters been hushed. Now the danger is
over; now the toil has ceased; now the gloom
has disappeared; now the firmament is
bounded only by the horizon; and what
a vast expanse of constellations can be
seen!</p>

<p>The river rolls by us in silent majesty; the
quiet of the camp is sweet; our joy is almost
ecstasy. We sit till long after midnight,
talking of the Grand Cañon, talking of home,
but chiefly talking of the three men who left
us. Are they wandering in those depths,
unable to find a way out? are they searching
over the desert lands above for water? or are
they nearing the settlements?</p>

<p><em>August 30.</em>—We run through two or three
short, low cañons to-day, and on emerging
from one, we discover a band of Indians in
the valley below. They see us, and scamper
away in most eager haste, to hide among the
rocks. Although we land, and call for them
to return, not an Indian can be seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[254]</span></p>

<p>Two or three miles farther down, in turning
a short bend in the river, we come upon
another camp. So near are we before they
can see us that I can shout to them, and,
being able to speak a little of their language,
I tell them we are friends; but they all flee
to the rocks, except a man, a woman, and
two children. We land, and talk with them.
They are without lodges, but have built little
shelters of boughs, under which they wallow
in the sand. The man is dressed in a hat;
the woman in a string of beads only. At
first they are evidently much terrified; but
when I talk to them in their own language,
and tell them we are friends, and inquire
after people in the Mormon towns, they are
soon reassured, and beg for tobacco. Of this
precious article we have none to spare. Sumner
looks around in the boat for something
to give them, and finds a little piece of colored
soap, which they receive as a valuable
present, rather as a thing of beauty than as
a useful commodity, however. They are
either unwilling or unable to tell us anything<span class="pagenum">[255]</span>
about the Indians or white people, and so we
push off, for we must lose no time.</p>

<p>We camp at noon under the right bank.
And now, as we push out, we are in great
expectancy, for we hope every minute to discover
the mouth of the Rio Virgen.</p>

<p>Soon one of the men exclaims: “Yonder’s
an Indian in the river.” Looking for a few
minutes, we certainly do see two or three persons.
The men bend to their oars, and pull
toward them. Approaching, we see that
there are three white men and an Indian
hauling a seine, and then we discover that it
is just at the mouth of the long sought river.</p>

<p>As we come near, the men seem far less
surprised to see us than we do to see them.
They evidently know who we are, and, on
talking with them, they tell us that we have
been reported lost long ago, and that some
weeks before, a messenger had been sent
from Salt Lake City, with instructions for
them to watch for any fragments or relics
of our party that might drift down the
stream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[256]</span></p>

<p>Our new found friends, Mr. Asa and his
two sons, tell us that they are pioneers of a
town that is to be built on the bank.</p>

<p>Eighteen or twenty miles up the valley of
the Rio Virgen there are two Mormon
towns, St. Joseph and St. Thomas. To-night
we dispatch an Indian to the last mentioned
place, to bring any letters that may
be there for us.</p>

<p>Our arrival here is very opportune.
When we look over our store of supplies, we
find about ten pounds of flour, fifteen pounds
of dried apples, but seventy or eighty pounds
of coffee.</p>

<p><em>August 31.</em>—This afternoon the Indian
returns with a letter, informing us that
Bishop Leithhead, of St. Thomas, and two
or three other Mormons are coming down
with a wagon, bringing us supplies. They
arrive about sundown. Mr. Asa treats us
with great kindness, to the extent of his ability;
but Bishop Leithhead brings in his
wagon two or three dozen melons, and many<span class="pagenum">[257]</span>
other little luxuries, and we are comfortable
once more.</p>

<p><em>September 1.</em>—This morning Sumner,
Bradley, Hawkins, and Hall, taking on a
small supply of rations, start down the Colorado
with the boats. It is their intention
to go to Fort Mojave, and perhaps from
there overland to Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Captain Powell and myself return with
Bishop Leithhead to St. Thomas. From
St. Thomas we go to Salt Lake City.</p>

</div>


<p class="dropcap">We have determined to continue
the exploration of the
cañons of the Colorado. Our
last trip was so hurried, owing to the loss
of rations, and the scientific instruments
were so badly injured, that we are not satisfied
with the results obtained, so we shall
once more attempt to pass through the
cañons in boats, devoting two or three years
to the trip.</p>

<p>It will not be possible to carry in the boats
sufficient supplies for the party for that
length of time, so it is thought best to establish
dépôts of supplies, at intervals of one
or two hundred miles along the river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[259]</span></p>

<p>Between Gunnison’s Crossing and the foot
of the Grand Cañon, we know of only two
points where the river can be reached—one
at the Crossing of the Fathers, and another a
few miles below, at the mouth of the Paria,
on a route which has been explored by Jacob
Hamblin, a Mormon missionary. These
two points are so near each other that only
one of them can be selected for the purpose
above mentioned, and others must be found.
We have been unable, up to this time, to obtain,
either from Indians or white men, any
information which will give us a clue to any
other trail to the river.</p>

<p>At the head waters of the Sevier, we are
on the summit of a great water-shed. The
Sevier itself flows north, and then westward,
into the lake of the same name. The Rio
Virgen, heading near by, flows to the southwest,
into the Colorado, sixty or seventy
miles below the Grand Cañon. The Kanab,
also heading near by, runs directly south,
into the very heart of the Grand Cañon.
The Paria, also heading near by, runs a little<span class="pagenum">[260]</span>
south of east, and enters the river at the
head of Marble Cañon. To the northeast
from this point, other streams, which run
into the Colorado, have their sources, until,
forty or fifty miles away, we reach the southern
branches of the Dirty Devil River, the
mouth of which stream is but a short distance
below the junction of the Grand and
Green.</p>

<p>The Pouns-a′-gunt Plateau terminates in
a point, which is bounded by a line of beautiful
pink cliffs. At the foot of this plateau,
on the west, the Rio Virgen and Sevier
Rivers are dovetailed together, as their minute
upper branches interlock. The upper
surface of the plateau inclines to the northeast,
so that its waters roll off into the Sevier;
but from the foot of the cliffs, quite around
the sharp angle of the plateau, for a dozen
miles, we find numerous springs, whose waters
unite to form the Kanab. But a little
farther to the northeast the springs gather
into streams that feed the Paria.</p>

<p>Here, by the upper springs of the Kanab,<span class="pagenum">[261]</span>
we make a camp, and from this point we are
to radiate on a series of trips, southwest,
south, and east.</p>

<p>Jacob Hamblin, who has been a missionary
among the Indians for more than twenty
years, has collected a number of <em>Kai′-vav-its</em>,
with <em>Chu-ar′-ru-um-peak</em>, their chief, and
they are all camped with us. They assure
us that we cannot reach the river; that we
cannot make our way into the depths of the
cañon, but promise to show us the springs
and water pockets, which are very scarce in
all this region, and to give us all the information
in their power.</p>

<p>Here we fit up a pack train, for our bedding
and instruments, and supplies are to be
carried on the backs of mules and ponies.</p>

<p><em>September 5, 1870.</em>—The several members
of the party are engaged in general preparation
for our trip down to the Grand Cañon.</p>

<p>Taking with me a white man and an Indian,
I start on a climb to the summit of the
Pouns-a′-gunt Plateau, which rises above us
on the east. Our way, for a mile or more, is<span class="pagenum">[262]</span>
over a great peat bog, that trembles under
our feet, and now and then a mule sinks
through the broken turf, and we are compelled
to pull it out with ropes.</p>

<p>Passing the bog, our way is up a gulch,
at the foot of the Pink Cliffs, which form the
escarpment, or wall, of the great plateau.
Soon we leave the gulch, and climb a long
ridge, which winds around to the right toward
the summit of the great table.</p>

<p>Two hours’ riding, climbing, and clambering
brings us near the top. We look below,
and see clouds drifting up from the south,
and rolling tumultuously toward the foot of
the cliffs, beneath us. Soon, all the country
below is covered with a sea of vapor—a billowy,
raging, noiseless sea—and as the
vapory flood still rolls up from the south,
great waves dash against the foot of the
cliffs and roll back; another tide comes in,
is hurled back, and another and another,
lashing the cliffs until the fog rises to the
summit, and covers us all.</p>

<p>There is a heavy pine and fir forest above,<span class="pagenum">[263]</span>
beset with dead and fallen timber, and we
make our way through the undergrowth to
the east.</p>

<p>It rains! The clouds discharge their
moisture in torrents, and we make for ourselves
shelters of boughs, which are soon
abandoned, and we stand shivering by a
great fire of pine logs and boughs, which we
have kindled, but which the pelting storm
half extinguishes.</p>

<p>One, two, three, four hours of the storm,
and at last it partially abates.</p>

<p>During this time our animals, which we
have turned loose, have sought for themselves
shelter under the trees, and two of them have
wandered away beyond our sight. I go out
to follow their tracks, and come near to the
brink of a ledge of rocks, which, in the fog
and mist, I suppose to be a little ridge, and
I look for a way by which I can go down.
Standing just here, there is a rift made in
the fog below, by some current or blast of
wind, which reveals an almost bottomless
abyss. I look from the brink of a great<span class="pagenum">[264]</span>
precipice of more than two thousand feet;
but, through the mist, the forms below are
half obscured, and all reckoning of distance
is lost, and it seems ten thousand feet, ten
miles—any distance the imagination desires
to make it.</p>

<p>Catching our animals, we return to the
camp. We find that the little streams which
come down from the plateau are greatly
swollen, but at camp they have had no rain.
The clouds which drifted up from the south,
striking against the plateau, were lifted up
into colder regions, and discharged their
moisture on the summit, and against the
sides of the plateau, but there was no rain in
the valley below.</p>

<p><em>September 9.</em>—We make a fair start this
morning, from the beautiful meadow at the
head of the Kanab, and cross the line of little
hills at the headwaters of the Rio Virgen,
and pass, to the south, a pretty valley,
and at ten o’clock come to the brink of a
great geographic bench—a line of cliffs.
Behind us are cool springs, green meadows,<span class="pagenum">[265]</span>
and forest clad slopes; below us, stretching
to the south, until the world is lost in blue
haze, is a painted desert; not a desert plain,
but a desert of rocks, cut by deep gorges,
and relieved by towering cliffs and pinnacled
rocks—naked rocks, brilliant in the sunlight.</p>

<p>By a difficult trail, we make our way down
the basaltic ledge, through which innumerable
streams here gather into a little river,
running in a deep cañon. The river runs
close to the foot of the cliffs, on the right
hand side, and the trail passes along to the
right. At noon we rest, and our animals
feed on luxuriant grass.</p>

<p>Again we start, and make slow progress
along a stony way. At night we camp under
an overarching cliff.</p>

<p><em>September 10.</em>—Here the river turns to
the west, and our way, properly, is to the
south; but we wish to explore the Rio Virgen
as far as possible. The Indians tell us
that the cañon narrows gradually, a few
miles below, and that it will be impossible to<span class="pagenum">[266]</span>
take our animals much farther down the
river. Early in the morning, I go down to
examine the head of this narrow part. After
breakfast, having concluded to explore the
cañon for a few miles on foot, we arrange
that the main party shall climb the cliff, and
go around to a point eighteen or twenty
miles below, where, the Indians say, the animals
can be taken down by the river, and
three of us set out on foot.</p>

<p>The Indian name of the cañon is <em>Pa-ru′-nu-weap</em>,
or Roaring Water Cañon. Between
the little river and the foot of the
walls, is a dense growth of willows, vines, and
wild rose bushes, and, with great difficulty,
we make our way through this tangled mass.
It is not a wide stream—only twenty or
thirty feet across in most places; shallow,
but very swift. After spending some hours
in breaking our way through the mass of
vegetation, and climbing rocks here and
there, it is determined to wade along the
stream. In some places this is an easy task,
but here and there we come to deep holes,<span class="pagenum">[267]</span>
where we have to wade to our arm pits.
Soon we come to places so narrow that the
river fills the entire channel, and we wade
perforce. In many places the bottom is a
quicksand, into which we sink, and it is with
great difficulty that we make progress. In
some places the holes are so deep that we
have to swim, and our little bundles of
blankets and rations are fixed to a raft made
of driftwood, and pushed before us. Now
and then there is a little flood-plain, on which
we can walk, and we cross and recross the
stream, and wade along the channel where
the water is so swift as to almost carry us
off our feet, and we are in danger every moment
of being swept down, until night comes
on. We estimate we have traveled eight
miles to-day. We find a little patch of
flood-plain, on which there is a huge pile of
driftwood and a clump of box-elders, and
near by a great stream, which bursts from the
rocks—a mammoth spring.</p>

<p>We soon have a huge fire, our clothes are
spread to dry, we make a cup of coffee, take<span class="pagenum">[268]</span>
out our bread and cheese and dried beef, and
enjoy a hearty supper.</p>

<p>The cañon here is about twelve hundred
feet deep. It has been very narrow and
winding all the way down to this point.</p>

<p><em>September 11.</em>—Wading again this morning;
sinking in the quicksand, swimming the
deep waters, and making slow and painful
progress where the waters are swift, and the
bed of the stream rocky.</p>

<p>The cañon is steadily becoming deeper,
and, in many places, very narrow—only
twenty or thirty feet wide below, and in some
places no wider, and even narrower, for hundreds
of feet overhead. There are places
where the river, in sweeping by curves, has
cut far under the rocks, but still preserving
its narrow channel, so that there is an overhanging
wall on one side and an inclined wall
on the other. In places a few hundred feet
above, it becomes vertical again, and thus
the view of the sky is entirely closed. Everywhere
this deep passage is dark and gloomy,
and resounds with the noise of rapid waters.<span class="pagenum">[269]</span>
At noon we are in a cañon 2,500 feet deep,
and we come to a fall where the walls are
broken down, and huge rocks beset the channel,
on which we obtain a foothold to reach
a level two hundred feet below. Here the
cañon is again wider, and we find a flood-plain,
along which we can walk, now on this,
and now on that side of the stream. Gradually
the cañon widens; steep rapids, cascades,
and cataracts are found along the
river, but we wade only when it is necessary
to cross. We make progress with very great
labor, having to climb over piles of broken
rocks.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon, we come to a little
clearing in the valley, and see other signs of
civilization, and by sundown arrive at the
Mormon town of Schunesburg; and here we
meet the train, and feast on melons and
grapes.</p>

<p><em>September 12.</em>—Our course, for the last
two days, through <em>Pa-ru′-nu-weap</em> Cañon,
was directly to the west. Another stream
comes down from the north, and unites just<span class="pagenum">[270]</span>
here at Schunesburg with the main branch
of the Rio Virgen. We determine to spend
a day in the exploration of this stream. The
Indians call the cañon, through which it runs,
<em>Mu-koon′-tu-weap</em>, or Straight Cañon. Entering
this, we have to wade up stream; often
the water fills the entire channel, and, although
we travel many miles, we find no
flood-plain, talus, or broken piles of rock at
the foot of the cliff. The walls have smooth,
plain faces, and are everywhere very regular
and vertical for a thousand feet or more,
where they seem to break back in shelving
slopes to higher altitudes; and everywhere,
as we go along, we find springs bursting out
at the foot of the walls, and, passing these,
the river above becomes steadily smaller; the
great body of water, which runs below, bursts
out from beneath this great bed of red sandstone;
as we go up the cañon, it comes to be
but a creek, and then a brook. On the western
wall of the cañon stand some buttes, towers,
and high pinnacled rocks. Going up
the cañon, we gain glimpses of them, here<span class="pagenum">[271]</span>
and there. Last summer, after our trip
through the cañons of the Colorado, on our
way from the mouth of the Virgen to Salt
Lake City, these were seen as conspicuous
landmarks, from a distance, away to the
southwest, of sixty or seventy miles. These
tower rocks are known as the Temples of the
Virgen.</p>

<p>Having explored this cañon nearly to its
head, we return to Schunesburg, arriving
quite late at night.</p>

<p>Sitting in camp this evening, <em>Chu-ar′-ru-um-peak</em>,
the chief of the <em>Kai′-vav-its</em>, who
is one of our party, tells us there is a tradition
among the tribes of this country, that
many years ago a great light was seen some-where
in this region by the <em>Pa-ru′-sha-pats</em>,
who lived to the southwest, and that they
supposed it to be a signal, kindled to warn
them of the approach of the <i lang="es">Navajos</i>, who
live beyond the Colorado River to the east.
Then other signal fires were kindled on the
Pine Valley Mountain, Santa Clara Mountains,
and U-in-ka-ret Mountains, so that all<span class="pagenum">[272]</span>
the tribes of Northern Arizona, Southern
Utah, Southern Nevada, and Southern California
were warned of the approaching danger;
but when the <em>Pa-ru′-sha-pats</em> came
nearer, they discovered that it was a fire on
one of the great Temples; and then they
knew that the fire was not kindled by men,
for no human being could scale the rocks.
The <em>Tu′-mu-ur-ru-gwait′-si-gaip</em>, or Rock
Rovers, had kindled a fire to deceive the people.
In the Indian language this is called
<em>Tu′-mu-ur-ru-gwait′-si-gaip Tu-weap′</em>, or
Rock Rovers’ Land.</p>

<p><em>September 13.</em>—We start very early this
morning, for we have a long day’s travel before
us. Our way is across the Rio Virgen to
the south. Coming to the bank of the stream
here, we find a strange metamorphosis. The
streams we have seen above, running in
narrow channels, leaping and plunging over
the rocks, raging and roaring in their course,
are here united, and spread in a thin sheet
several hundred yards wide, and only a few
inches deep, but running over a bed of quicksand.<span class="pagenum">[273]</span>
Crossing the stream, our trail leads
up a narrow cañon, not very deep, and then
among the hills of golden, red, and purple
shales and marls. Climbing out of the valley
of the Rio Virgen, we pass through a forest
of dwarf cedars, and come out at the foot
of the Vermilion Cliffs. All day we follow
this Indian trail toward the east, and at night
camp at a great spring, known to the Indians
as Yellow Rock Spring, but to the Mormons
as Pipe Spring; and near by there is a cabin
in which some Mormon herders find shelter.
Pipe Spring is a point just across the Utah
line in Arizona, and we suppose it to be about
sixty miles from the river. Here the Mormons
design to build a fort another year, as
an outpost for protection against the Indians.</p>

<p>Here we discharge a number of the Indians,
but take two with us for the purpose of
showing us the springs, for they are very
scarce, very small, and not easily found.
Half a dozen are not known in a district of
country large enough to make as many good<span class="pagenum">[274]</span>
sized counties in Illinois. There are no running
streams, and these springs and water-pockets—that
is, holes in the rocks, which
hold water from shower to shower—are our
only dependence for this element.</p>

<p>Starting, we leave behind a long line of
cliffs, many hundred feet high, composed of
orange and vermilion sandstones. I have
named them “Vermilion Cliffs.” When we
are out a few miles, I look back, and see the
morning sun shining in splendor on their
painted faces; the salient angles are on fire,
and the retreating angles are buried in shade,
and I gaze on them until my vision dreams,
and the cliffs appear a long bank of purple
clouds, piled from the horizon high into the
heavens. At noon we pass along a ledge of
chocolate cliffs, and, taking out our sandwiches,
we make a dinner as we ride along.</p>

<p>Yesterday, our Indians discussed for
hours the route which we should take. There
is one way, farther by ten or twelve miles,
with sure water; another shorter, where water
is found sometimes; their conclusion was<span class="pagenum">[275]</span>
that water would be found now; and this is
the way we go, yet all day long we are anxious
about it. To be out two days, with only
the water that can be carried in two small
kegs, is to have our animals suffer greatly.
At five o’clock we come to the spot, and
there is a huge water-pocket, containing several
barrels. What a relief! Here we
camp for the night.</p>

<p><em>September 15.</em>—Up at day-break, for it is
a long day’s march to the next water. They
say we must “run very hard” to reach it by
dark.</p>

<p>Our course is to the south. From Pipe
Spring we can see a mountain, and I recognize
it as the one seen last summer from a
cliff overlooking the Grand Cañon; and I
wish to reach the river just behind the mountain.
There are Indians living in the group,
of which it is the highest, whom I wish to
visit on the way. These mountains are of
volcanic origin, and we soon come to ground
that is covered with fragments of lava. The
way becomes very difficult. We have to<span class="pagenum">[276]</span>
cross deep ravines, the heads of cañons that
run into the Grand Cañon. It is curious
now to observe the knowledge of our Indians.
There is not a trail but what they know;
every gulch and every rock seems familiar.
I have prided myself on being able to grasp
and retain in my mind the topography of a
country; but these Indians put me to shame.
My knowledge is only general, embracing
the more important features of a region that
remains as a map engraved on my mind; but
theirs is particular. They know every rock
and every ledge, every gulch and cañon, and
just where to wind among these to find a
pass; and their knowledge is unerring. They
cannot describe a country to you, but they
can tell you all the particulars of a route.</p>

<p>I have but one pony for the two, and they
were to ride “turn about”; but <em>Chu-ar′-ru-um-peak</em>,
the chief, rides, and <em>Shuts</em>, the one-eyed,
bare-legged, merry-faced pigmy,
walks, and points the way with a slender
cane; then leaps and bounds by the shortest
way, and sits down on a rock and waits demurely<span class="pagenum">[277]</span>
until we come, always meeting us
with a jest, his face a rich mine of sunny
smiles.</p>

<p>At dusk we reach the water-pocket. It is
in a deep gorge, on the flank of this great
mountain. During the rainy season the water
rolls down the mountain side, plunging
over precipices, and excavates a deep basin
in the solid rock below. This basin, hidden
from the sun, holds water the year round.</p>

<p><em>September 16.</em>—This morning, while the
men are packing the animals, I climb a little
mountain near camp, to obtain a view of the
country. It is a huge pile of volcanic scoria,
loose and light as cinders from a forge, which
give way under my feet, and I climb with
great labor; but reaching the summit, and
looking to the southeast, I see once more the
labyrinth of deep gorges that flank the
Grand Cañon; in the multitude, I cannot determine
whether it be in view or not. The
memories of grand and awful months spent
in their deep, gloomy solitudes come up, and
I live that life over again for a time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[278]</span></p>

<p>I supposed, before starting, that I could
get a good view of the great mountain from
this point; but it is like climbing a chair to
look at a castle. I wish to discover some way
by which it can be ascended, as it is my intention
to go to the summit before I return to
the settlements. There is a cliff near the
summit, and I do not see the way yet. Now
down I go, sliding on the cinders, making
them rattle and clang.</p>

<p>The Indians say we are to have a short ride
to-day, and that we will reach an Indian village,
situated by a good spring. Our way
is across the spurs that put out from the
great mountain, as we pass it to the left.</p>

<p>Up and down we go, across deep ravines,
and the fragments of lava clank under our
horses’ feet; now among cedars, now among
pines, and now across mountain side glades.
At one o’clock we descend into a lovely valley,
with a carpet of waving grass; sometimes
there is a little water in the upper end
of it, and, during some seasons, the Indians
we wish to find are encamped here. <em>Chu-ar′-ru-um-peak</em><span class="pagenum">[279]</span>
rides on to find them, and to
say we are friends, otherwise they would run
away, or propose to fight us, should we come
without notice. Soon we see <em>Chu-ar′-ru-um-peak</em>
riding at full speed, and hear him shouting
at the top of his voice, and away in the
distance are two Indians, scampering up the
mountain side. One stops; the other still
goes on, and is soon lost to view. We ride
up, and find <em>Chu-ar′-ru-um-peak</em> talking
with the one who had stopped. It is one of
the ladies resident in these mountain glades;
she is evidently paying taxes, Godiva like.
She tells us that her people are at the spring;
that it is only two hours’ ride; that her good
master has gone on to tell them we are coming,
and that she is harvesting seeds.</p>

<p>We sit down and eat our luncheon, and
share our biscuit with the woman of the
mountains; then on we go, over a divide between
two rounded peaks. I send the party
on to the village, and climb the peak on the
left, riding my horse to the upper limit of
trees, and then tugging up afoot. From this<span class="pagenum">[280]</span>
point I can see the Grand Cañon, and know
where I am. I can see the Indian village,
too, in a grassy valley, embosomed in the
mountains, the smoke curling up from their
fires; my men are turning out their horses,
and a group of natives stand around. Down
the mountain I go, and reach camp at sunset.</p>

<p>After supper we put some cedar boughs
on the fire, the dusky villagers sit around,
and we have a smoke and a talk. I explain
the object of my visit, and assure them of
my friendly intentions. Then I ask them
about a way down into the cañon. They tell
me that years ago, a way was discovered by
which parties could go down, but that no one
has attempted it for a long time; that it is
a very difficult and very dangerous undertaking
to reach the “Big Water.” Then I
inquire about the <em>Shi′-vwits</em>, a tribe that lives
about the springs on the mountain sides and
cañon cliffs to the southwest. They say that
their village is now about thirty miles away,<span class="pagenum">[281]</span>
and promise to send a messenger for them to-morrow
morning.</p>

<p>Having finished our business for the evening,
I ask if there is a <em>tu-gwi′-na-gunt</em> in
camp: that is, if there is any one present
who is skilled in relating their mythology.
<em>Chu-ar′-ru-um-peak</em> says <em>To-mor′-ro-un-ti-kai</em>,
the chief of these Indians, is a very noted
man for his skill in this matter; but they both
object, by saying that the season for <em>tu-gwi′-nai</em>
has not yet arrived. But I had anticipated
this, and soon some members of the
party come with pipes and tobacco, a large
kettle of coffee, and a tray of biscuits, and,
after sundry ceremonies of pipe lighting and
smoking, we all feast, and, warmed up by
this, to them, unusual good living, it is decided
that the night shall be spent in relating
mythology. I ask <em>To-mor′-ro-un-ti-kai</em> to
tell us about the <em>So′-kus Wai′-un-ats</em>, or
One Two Boys, and to this he agrees.</p>

<p>The long winter evenings of an Indian
camp are usually devoted to the relation of<span class="pagenum">[282]</span>
mythological stories, which purport to give
a history of an ancient race of animal gods.
The stories are usually told by some old man,
assisted by others of the party, who take secondary
parts, while the members of the tribe
gather about, and make comments, or receive
impressions from the morals which are enforced
by the story teller, or, more properly,
story tellers; for the exercise partakes somewhat
of the nature of a theatrical performance.</p>


<h3>THE SO′-KUS WAI′-UN-ATS.</h3>

<p><em>Tum-pwi-nai′-ro-gwi-nump</em>, he who had
a stone shirt, killed <em>Si-kor′</em>, the Crane, and
stole his wife, and seeing that she had a child,
and thinking it would be an incumbrance to
them on their travels, he ordered her to kill
it. But the mother, loving the babe, hid it
under her dress, and carried it away to its
grandmother. And Stone Shirt carried his
captured bride to his own land.</p>

<p>In a few years the child grew to be a fine<span class="pagenum">[283]</span>
lad, under the care of his grandmother, and
was her companion wherever she went.</p>

<p>One day they were digging flag roots, on
the margin of the river, and putting them in
a heap on the bank. When they had been
at work a little while, the boy perceived that
the roots came up with greater ease than was
customary, and he asked the old woman the
cause of this, but she did not know; and, as
they continued their work, still the reeds
came up with less effort, at which their wonder
increased, until the grandmother said,
“Surely, some strange thing is about to transpire.”
Then the boy went to the heap,
where they had been placing the roots, and
found that some one had taken them away,
and he ran back, exclaiming, “Grandmother,
did you take the roots away?” And she answered,
“No, my child; perhaps some ghost
has taken them off; let us dig no more; come
away.” But the boy was not satisfied, as he
greatly desired to know what all this meant;
so he searched about for a time, and at length<span class="pagenum">[284]</span>
found a man sitting under a tree, whom he
taunted with being a thief, and threw mud
and stones at him, until he broke the stranger’s
leg, who answered not the boy, nor resented
the injuries he received, but remained
silent and sorrowful; and, when his leg was
broken, he tied it up in sticks, and bathed it
in the river, and sat down again under the
tree, and beckoned the boy to approach.
When the lad came near, the stranger told
him he had something of great importance
to reveal. “My son,” said he, “did that old
woman ever tell you about your father and
mother?” “No,” answered the boy; “I have
never heard of them.” “My son, do you see
these bones scattered on the ground? Whose
bones are these?” “How should I know?”
answered the boy. “It may be that some
elk or deer has been killed here.” “No,”
said the old man. “Perhaps they are the
bones of a bear;” but the old man shook his
head. So the boy mentioned many other
animals, but the stranger still shook his head,
and finally said, “These are the bones of your<span class="pagenum">[285]</span>
father; Stone Shirt killed him, and left him
to rot here on the ground, like a wolf.” And
the boy was filled with indignation against
the slayer of his father. Then the stranger
asked, “Is your mother in yonder lodge?”
and the boy replied, “No.” “Does your
mother live on the banks of this river?” and
the boy answered, “I don’t know my mother;
I have never seen her; she is dead.” “My
son,” replied the stranger, “Stone Shirt, who
killed your father, stole your mother, and
took her away to the shore of a distant lake,
and there she is his wife to-day.” And the
boy wept bitterly, and while the tears filled
his eyes so that he could not see, the stranger
disappeared. Then the boy was filled with
wonder at what he had seen and heard, and
malice grew in his heart against his father’s
enemy. He returned to the old woman, and
said, “Grandmother, why have you lied to
me about my father and mother?” and she
answered not, for she knew that a ghost had
told all to the boy. And the boy fell upon
the ground weeping and sobbing, until he<span class="pagenum">[286]</span>
fell into a deep sleep, when strange things
were told him.</p>

<p>His slumber continued three days and
three nights, and when he awoke, he said to
his grandmother: “I am going away to enlist
all nations in my fight;” and straightway
he departed.</p>

<p>(Here the boy’s travels are related with
many circumstances concerning the way he
was received by the people, all given in a
series of conversations, very lengthy, so they
will be omitted.)</p>

<p>Finally he returned in advance of the people
whom he had enlisted, bringing with him
<em>Shin-au′-av</em>, the wolf, and <em>To-go′-av</em>, the rattlesnake.
When the three had eaten food,
the boy said to the old woman: “Grandmother,
cut me in two!” But she demurred,
saying she did not wish to kill one whom she
loved so dearly. “Cut me in two!” demanded
the boy; and he gave her a stone ax,
which he had brought from a distant country,
and with a manner of great authority he
again commanded her to cut him in two. So<span class="pagenum">[287]</span>
she stood before him, and severed him in
twain, and fled in terror. And lo! each part
took the form of an entire man, and the one
beautiful boy appeared as two, and they
were so much alike no one could tell them
apart.</p>

<p>When the people or natives, whom the boy
had enlisted, came pouring into the camp,
<em>Shin-au′-av</em> and <em>To-go′-av</em> were engaged in
telling them of the wonderful thing that had
happened to the boy, and that now there
were two; and they all held it to be an augury
of a successful expedition to the land of
Stone Shirt. And they started on their
journey.</p>

<p>Now the boy had been told in the dream
of his three days’ slumber, of a magical cup,
and he had brought it home with him from
his journey among the nations, and the <em>So′-kus
Wai′-un-ats</em> carried it between them,
filled with water. <em>Shin-au′-av</em> walked on
their right, and <em>To-go′-av</em> on their left, and
the nations followed in the order in which
they had been enlisted. There was a vast<span class="pagenum">[288]</span>
number of them, so that when they were
stretched out in line it was one day’s journey
from the front to the rear of the column.</p>

<p>When they had journeyed two days, and
were far out on the desert, all the people
thirsted, for they found no water, and they
fell down upon the sand, groaning, and murmuring
that they had been deceived, and they
cursed the One-Two.</p>

<p>But the <em>So′-kus Wai′-un-ats</em> had been told
in the wonderful dream of the suffering
which would be endured, and that the water
which they carried in the cup was only to be
used in dire necessity; and the brothers said
to each other: “Now the time has come for
us to drink the water.” And when one had
quaffed of the magical bowl, he found it still
full; and he gave it to the other to drink, and
still it was full; and the One-Two gave it
to the people, and one after another did they
all drink, and still the cup was full to the
brim.</p>

<p>But <em>Shin-au′-av</em> was dead, and all the
people mourned, for he was a great man.<span class="pagenum">[289]</span>
The brothers held the cup over him, and
sprinkled him with water, when he arose and
said: “Why do you disturb me? I did have
a vision of mountain brooks and meadows,
of cane where honey-dew was plenty.” They
gave him the cup, and he drank also; but
when he had finished there was none left.
Refreshed and rejoicing they proceeded on
their journey.</p>

<p>The next day, being without food, they
were hungry, and all were about to perish;
and again they murmured at the brothers,
and cursed them. But the <em>So′-kus Wai′-un-ats</em>
saw in the distance an antelope, standing
on an eminence in the plain, in bold relief
against the sky; and <em>Shin-au′-av</em> knew it was
the wonderful antelope with many eyes,
which Stone Shirt kept for his watchman;
and he proposed to go and kill it, but <em>To-go′-av</em>
demurred, and said: “It were better
that I should go, for he will see you, and run
away.” But the <em>So′-kus Wai′-un-ats</em> told
<em>Shin-au′-av</em> to go; and he started in a direction
away to the left of where the antelope<span class="pagenum">[290]</span>
was standing, that he might make a long
detour about some hills, and come upon him
from the other side. <em>To-go′-av</em> went a little
way from camp, and called to the brothers:
“Do you see me?” and they answered
they did not. “Hunt for me;” and while
they were hunting for him, the rattlesnake
said: “I can see you; you are doing”—so
and so, telling them what they were doing;
but they could not find him.</p>

<p>Then the rattlesnake came forth, declaring:
“Now you know I can see others, and
that I cannot be seen when I so desire. <em>Shin-au′-av</em>
cannot kill that antelope, for he has
many eyes, and is the wonderful watchman
of Stone Shirt; but I can kill him, for I can
go where he is, and he cannot see me.” So
the brothers were convinced, and permitted
him to go; and he went and killed the antelope.
When <em>Shin-au′-av</em> saw it fall, he was
very angry, for he was extremely proud of
his fame as a hunter, and anxious to have the
honor of killing this famous antelope, and
he ran up with the intention of killing <em>To-go′-av</em>;<span class="pagenum">[291]</span>
but when he drew near, and saw the
antelope was fat, and would make a rich feast
for the people, his anger was appeased.
“What matters it,” said he, “who kills the
game, when we can all eat it?”</p>

<p>So all the people were fed in abundance,
and they proceeded on their journey.</p>

<p>The next day the people again suffered for
water, and the magical cup was empty; but
the <em>So′-kus Wai′-un-ats</em>, having been told in
their dream what to do, transformed themselves
into doves, and flew away to a lake, on
the margin of which was the home of Stone
Shirt.</p>

<p>Coming near to the shore, they saw two
maidens bathing in the water; and the birds
stood and looked, for the maidens were very
beautiful. Then they flew into some bushes,
near by, to have a nearer view, and were
caught in a snare which the girls had placed
for intrusive birds. The beautiful maidens
came up, and, taking the birds out of the
snare, admired them very much, for they had
never seen such birds before. They carried<span class="pagenum">[292]</span>
them to their father, Stone Shirt, who said:
“My daughters, I very much fear these are
spies from my enemies, for such birds do not
live in our land;” and he was about to throw
them into the fire, when the maidens besought
him, with tears, that he would not destroy
their beautiful birds; but he yielded to their
entreaties with much misgiving. Then they
took the birds to the shore of the lake, and set
them free.</p>

<p>When the birds were at liberty once more,
they flew around among the bushes, until
they found the magical cup which they had
lost, and taking it up, they carried it out into
the middle of the lake and settled down upon
the water, and the maidens supposed they
were drowned.</p>

<p>The birds, when they had filled their cup,
rose again, and went back to the people in
the desert, where they arrived just at the
right time to save them with the cup of water,
from which each drank; and yet it was full
until the last was satisfied, and then not a
drop remained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[293]</span></p>

<p>The brothers reported that they had seen
Stone Shirt and his daughters.</p>

<p>The next day they came near to the home
of the enemy, and the brothers, in proper
person, went out to reconnoitre. Seeing a
woman gleaning seeds, they drew near, and
knew it was their mother, whom Stone Shirt
had stolen from <em>Si-kor′</em>, the crane. They
told her they were her sons, but she denied
it, and said she had never had but one son;
but the boys related to her their history, with
the origin of the two from one, and she was
convinced. She tried to dissuade them from
making war upon Stone Shirt, and told them
that no arrow could possibly penetrate his
armor, and that he was a great warrior, and
had no other delight than in killing his enemies,
and that his daughters also were furnished
with magical bows and arrows, which
they could shoot so fast that the arrows
would fill the air like a cloud, and that it was
not necessary for them to take aim, for their
missiles went where they willed; they <em>thought</em>
the arrows to the hearts of their enemies; and<span class="pagenum">[294]</span>
thus the maidens could kill the whole of the
people before a common arrow could be shot
by a common person. But the boys told her
what the spirit had said in the long dream,
and had promised that Stone Shirt should
be killed. They told her to go down to the
lake at dawn, so as not to be endangered by
the battle.</p>

<p>During the night, the <em>So′-kus Wai′-un-ats</em>
transformed themselves into mice, and proceeded
to the home of Stone Shirt, and found
the magical bows and arrows that belonged
to the maidens, and with their sharp teeth
they cut the sinew on the backs of the bows,
and nibbled the bow strings, so that they were
worthless; while <em>To-go′-av</em> hid himself under
a rock near by.</p>

<p>When dawn came into the sky, <em>Tum-pwi-nai′-ro-gwi-nump</em>,
the Stone Shirt man, arose
and walked out of his tent, exulting in his
strength and security, and sat down upon
the rock under which <em>To-go′-av</em> was hiding;
and he, seeing his opportunity, sunk his fangs<span class="pagenum">[295]</span>
into the flesh of the hero. Stone Shirt
sprang high into the air, and called to his
daughters that they were betrayed, and that
the enemy was near; and they seized their
magical bows, and their quivers filled with
magical arrows, and hurried to his defense.
At the same time, all the nations who were
surrounding the camp rushed down to battle.
But the beautiful maidens, finding their
weapons were destroyed, waved back their
enemies, as if they would parley; and, standing
for a few moments over the body of their
slain father, sang the death song, and danced
the death dance, whirling in giddy circles
about the dead hero, and wailing with despair,
until they sank down and expired.</p>

<p>The conquerors buried the maidens by the
shores of the lake; but <em>Tum-pwi-nai′-ro-gwi-nump</em>
was left to rot, and his bones to bleach
on the sands, as he had left <em>Si-kor′</em>.</p>

<p>There is this proverb among the Utes:
“Do not murmur when you suffer in doing
what the spirits have commanded, for a cup<span class="pagenum">[296]</span>
of water is provided.” And another:
“What matters it who kills the game, when
we can all eat of it.”</p>

<p>It is long after midnight when the performance
is ended. The story itself was interesting,
though I had heard it many times
before; but never, perhaps, under circumstances
more effective. Stretched beneath
tall, sombre pines; a great camp fire, and by
the fire, men, old, wrinkled, and ugly; deformed,
blear eyed, wry faced women; lithe,
stately young men; pretty but simpering
maidens, naked children, all intently listening,
or laughing and talking at times, their
strange faces and dusky forms lit up with the
glare of the pine-knot fire. All the circumstances
conspired to make it a scene strange
and weird. One old man, the sorcerer or
medicine-man of the tribe, peculiarly impressed
me. Now and then he would interrupt
the play for the purpose of correcting
the speakers, or impressing the moral of the
story with a strange dignity and impressiveness
that seemed to pass to the very border<span class="pagenum">[297]</span>
of the ludicrous; yet at no time did it make
me smile.</p>

<p>The story is finished, but there is yet time
for an hour or two’s sleep. I take <em>Chu-ar′-ru-um-peak</em>
to one side for a talk. The
three men who left us in the cañon last year
found their way up the lateral gorge, by
which they went into the <em>Shi′-vwits</em> Mountains,
lying west of us, where they met with
the Indians, and camped with them one or
two nights, and were finally killed. I am
anxious to learn the circumstances, and as
the people of the tribe who committed the
deed live but a little way from and are intimate
with these people, I ask <em>Chu-ar′-ru-um-peak</em>
to make inquiry for me. Then we go
to bed.</p>

<p><em>September 17.</em>—Early this morning the
Indians come up to our camp. They have
concluded to send out a young man after the
<em>Shi′-vwits</em>. The runner fixes his moccasins,
puts some food in a sack and water in a little
wicker work jug, straps them on his back,
and starts at a good round pace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[298]</span></p>

<p>We have concluded to go down the cañon,
hoping to meet the <em>Shi′-vwits</em> on our return.
Soon we are ready to start, leaving the camp
and pack animals in charge of the two Indians
who came with us. As we move out,
our new guide comes up, a blear eyed, weazen
faced, quiet old man, with his bow and arrows
in one hand, and a small cane in the
other. These Indians all carry canes with
a crooked handle, they say to kill rattlesnakes,
and to pull rabbits from their holes.
The valley is high up in the mountain, and
we descend from it, by a rocky, precipitous
trail, down, down, down for two long, weary
hours, leading our ponies and stumbling over
the rocks. At last we are at the foot of the
mountain, standing on a little knoll, from
which we can look into a cañon below. Into
this we descend, and then we follow it for
miles, clambering down and still down.
Often we cross beds of lava, that have been
poured into the cañon by lateral channels,
and these angular fragments of basalt make
the way very rough for the animals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[299]</span></p>

<p>About two o’clock the guide halts us with
his wand, and springing over the rocks he is
lost in a gulch. In a few minutes he returns,
and tells us there is a little water below in a
pocket. It is vile and stinking, and our
ponies refuse to drink it. We pass on, still
ever descending. A mile or two from the
water basin we come to a precipice, more than
a thousand feet to the bottom. There is a
cañon running at a greater depth, and at
right angles to this, into which this enters by
the precipice; and this second cañon is a lateral
one to the greater one, in the bottom of
which we are to find the river. Searching
about, we find a way by which we can descend
along the shelves, and steps, and piles
of broken rocks.</p>

<p>We start leading our ponies; a wall upon
our left; unknown depths on our right. At
places our way is along shelves so narrow,
or so sloping, that I ache with fear lest a pony
should make a misstep, and knock a man over
the cliffs with him. Now and then we start
the loose rocks under our feet, and over the<span class="pagenum">[300]</span>
cliffs they go, thundering down, down, as the
echoes roll through distant cañons. At last
we pass along a level shelf for some distance,
then we turn to the right, and zigzag down
a steep slope to the bottom. Now we pass
along this lower cañon, for two or three
miles, to where it terminates in the Grand
Cañon, as the other ended in this, only the
river is 1,800 feet below us, and it seems,
at this distance, to be but a creek. Our withered
guide, the human pickle, seats himself
on a rock, and seems wonderfully amused
at our discomfiture, for we can see no way
by which to descend to the river. After
some minutes, he quietly rises, and, beckoning
us to follow, he points out a narrow sloping
shelf on the right, and this is to be our
way. It leads along the cliff, for half a mile,
to a wider bench beyond, which, he says, is
broken down on the other side in a great
slide, and there we can get to the river. So
we start out on the shelf; it is so steep we
can hardly stand on it, and to fall, or slip,
is to go—don’t look and see!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[301]</span></p>

<p>It is soon manifest that we cannot get the
ponies along the ledge. The storms have
washed it down, since our guide was here
last, years ago. One of the ponies has gone
so far that we cannot turn him back until
we find a wider place, but at last we get
him off. With part of the men, I take the
horses back to the place where there are a
few bushes growing, and turn them loose;
in the meantime the other men are looking
for some way by which we can get down to
the river. When I return, one, Captain
Bishop, has found a way, and gone down.
We pack bread, coffee, sugar, and two or
three blankets among us, and set out. It
is now nearly dark, and we cannot find the
way by which the captain went, and an hour
is spent in fruitless search. Two of the men
go away around an amphitheater, more than
a fourth of a mile, and start down a broken
chasm that faces us, who are behind. These
walls, that are vertical, or nearly so, are often
cut by chasms, where the showers run down,
and the top of these chasms will be back a<span class="pagenum">[302]</span>
distance from the face of the wall, and the
bed of the chasm will slope down, with here
and there a fall. At other places, huge
rocks have fallen, and block the way. Down
such a one the two men start. There is a
curious plant growing out from the crevices
of the rock. A dozen stems will start from
one root, and grow to the length of eight or
ten feet, and not throw out a branch or twig,
but these stems are thickly covered with
leaves. Now and then the two men come
to a bunch of dead stems, and make a fire to
mark for us their way and progress.</p>

<p>In the meantime we find such a gulch,
and start down, but soon come to the “jumping
off place,” where we can throw a stone,
and hear it faintly striking, away below.
We fear that we shall have to stay here,
clinging to the rocks until daylight. Our
little Indian gathers a few dry stems, ties
them into a bundle, lights one end, and holds
it up. The others do the same, and with
these torches we find a way out of trouble.
Helping each other, holding torches for each<span class="pagenum">[303]</span>
other, one clinging to another’s hand until
we can get footing, then supporting the other
on his shoulders, so we make our passage
into the depths of the cañon. And now
Captain Bishop has kindled a huge fire of
driftwood, on the bank of the river. This,
and the fires in the gulch opposite, and our
own flaming torches, light up little patches,
that make more manifest the awful darkness
below. Still, on we go, for an hour or two,
and at last we see Captain Bishop coming
up the gulch, with a huge torch-light on his
shoulders. He looks like a fiend, waving
brands and lighting the fires of hell, and the
men in the opposite gulch are imps, lighting
delusive fires in inaccessible crevices, over
yawning chasms; our own little Indian is
surely the king of wizards, so I think, as
I stop for a few moments on a rock to rest.
At last we meet Captain Bishop, with his
flaming torch, and, as he has learned the way,
he soon pilots us to the side of the great Colorado.
We are hungry and athirst, almost
to starvation. Here we lie down on the<span class="pagenum">[304]</span>
rocks and drink, just a mouthful or so, as
we dare; then we make a cup of coffee, and,
spreading our blankets on a sand beach, the
roaring Colorado lulls us to sleep.</p>

<p><em>September 18.</em>—We are in the Grand
Cañon, by the side of the Colorado, more
than six thousand feet below our camp on
the mountain side, which is eighteen miles
away; but the miles of horizontal distance
represent but a small part of the day’s labor
before us. It is the mile of altitude we must
gain that makes it a herculean task. We
are up early; a little bread and coffee, and
we look about us. Our conclusion is, that
we can make this a dépôt of supplies, should
it be necessary; that we can pack our rations
to the point where we left our animals last
night, and that we can employ Indians to
bring them down to the water’s edge.</p>

<p>On a broad shelf, we find the ruins of an
old stone house, the walls of which are broken
down, and we can see where the ancient people
who lived here—a race more highly civilized
than the present—had made a garden,<span class="pagenum">[305]</span>
and used a great spring, that comes out of
the rocks, for irrigation. On some rocks
near by we discover some curious etchings.
Still, searching about, we find an obscure
trail up the cañon wall, marked, here and
there, by steps which have been built in the
loose rock, elsewhere hewn stairways, and
we find a much easier way to go up than
that by which we came down in the darkness
last night. Coming to the top of the wall,
we catch our horses, and start. Up the
cañon our jaded ponies toil, and we reach
the second cliff; up this we go, by easy stages,
leading the animals. Now we reach the
stinking water-pocket; our ponies have had
no water for thirty hours, and are eager even
for this foul fluid. We carefully strain a
kettleful for ourselves, then divide what is
left between them—two or three gallons for
each; but this does not satisfy them, and
they rage around, refusing to eat the scanty
grass. We boil our kettle of water, and
skim it; straining, boiling, and skimming
makes it a little better, for it was full of<span class="pagenum">[306]</span>
loathsome, wriggling larvæ, with huge black
heads. But plenty of coffee takes away the
bad smell, and so modifies the taste that most
of us can drink, though our little Indian
seems to prefer the original mixture. We
reach camp about sunset, and are glad to
rest.</p>

<p><em>September 19.</em>—We are tired and sore,
and must rest a day with our Indian neighbors.
During the inclement season they
live in shelters, made of boughs, or bark of
the cedar, which they strip off in long shreds.
In this climate, most of the year is dry and
warm, and during such time they do not care
for shelter. Clearing a small, circular space
of ground, they bank it around with brush
and sand, and wallow in it during the day,
and huddle together in a heap at night, men,
women, and children; buckskin, rags, and
sand. They wear very little clothing, not
needing much in this lovely climate.</p>

<p>Altogether, these Indians are more nearly
in their primitive condition than any others
on the continent with whom I am acquainted.<span class="pagenum">[307]</span>
They have never received anything from the
Government, and are too poor to tempt the
trader, and their country is so nearly inaccessible
that the white man never visits them.
The sunny mountain side is covered with
wild fruits, nuts, and native grains, upon
which they subsist. The <em>oose</em>, the fruit of
the yucca, or Spanish bayonet, is rich, and
not unlike the paw-paw of the valley of the
Ohio. They eat it raw, and also roast it
in the ashes. They gather the fruits of a
cactus plant, which is rich and luscious, and
eat them as grapes, or from them express
the juice, making the dry pulp into cakes,
and saving them for winter; the wine they
drink about their camp fires, until the midnight
is merry with the revelries.</p>

<p>They gather the seeds of many plants, as
sunflowers, goldenrods, and grasses. For
this purpose, they have large conical baskets,
which hold two or more bushels. The
women carry them on their backs, suspended
from their foreheads by broad straps, and
with a smaller one in the left hand, and a<span class="pagenum">[308]</span>
willow woven fan in the right, they walk
among the grasses, and sweep the seed into
the smaller basket, which is emptied, now
and then, into the larger, until it is full of
seeds and chaff; then they winnow out the
chaff and roast the seeds. They roast these
curiously; they put the seeds, with a quantity
of red hot coals, into a willow tray, and,
by rapidly and dexterously shaking and
tossing them, keep the coals aglow, and the
seeds and tray from burning. As if by
magic, so skilled are the crones in this work,
they roll the seeds to one side of the tray,
as they are roasted, and the coals to the
other. Then they grind the seeds into a fine
flour, and make it into cakes and mush.</p>

<p>It is a merry sight, sometimes, to see the
women grinding at the mill. For a mill,
they use a large flat rock, lying on the
ground, and another small cylindrical one
in their hands. They sit prone on the
ground, hold the large flat rock between the
feet and legs, then fill their laps with seeds,
making a hopper to the mill with their dusky<span class="pagenum">[309]</span>
legs, and grind by pushing the seeds across
the larger rock, where it drops into a tray.
I have seen a group of women grinding together,
keeping time to a chant, or gossiping
and chatting, while the younger lassies would
jest and chatter, and make the pine woods
merry with their laughter. Mothers carry
their babes curiously in baskets. They make
a wicker board, by plaiting willows, and sew
a buckskin cloth to either edge, and this is
fulled in the middle, so as to form a sack,
closed at the bottom. At the top, they make
a wicker shade, like “my grandmother’s sun
bonnet,” and, wrapping the little one in a
wild cat robe, place it in the basket, and this
they carry on their backs, strapped over the
forehead, and the little brown midgets are
ever peering over their mother’s shoulders.
In camp, they stand the basket against the
trunk of a tree, or hang it to a limb.</p>

<p>There is little game in the country, yet
they get a mountain sheep now and then,
or a deer, with their arrows, for they are not
yet supplied with guns. They get many<span class="pagenum">[310]</span>
rabbits, sometimes with arrows, sometimes
with nets. They make a net of twine, made
of the fibers of a native flax. Sometimes
this is made a hundred yards in length, and
is placed in a half circular position, with
wings of sage brush. They have a circle
hunt, and drive great numbers of rabbits
into the snare, where they are shot with arrows.
Most of their bows are made of cedar,
but the best are made of the horns of
mountain sheep. These are taken, soaked
in water, until quite soft, cut into long thin
strips, and glued together, and are then quite
elastic. During the autumn, grasshoppers
are very abundant. When cold weather sets
in, these insects are numbed, and can be
gathered by the bushel. At such a time, they
dig a hole in the sand, heat stones in a fire
near by, put some in the bottom of the hole,
put on a layer of grasshoppers, then a layer
of hot stones, and continue this, until they
put bushels on to roast. There they are left
until cool, when they are taken out, thoroughly
dried, and ground into meal. Grasshopper<span class="pagenum">[311]</span>
gruel, or grasshopper cake, is a great
treat.</p>

<p>Their lore consists in a mass of traditions,
or mythology. It is very difficult to induce
them to tell it to white men; but the old
Spanish priests, in the days of the conquest
of New Mexico, have spread among the Indians
of this country many Bible stories,
which the Indians are usually willing to tell.
It is not always easy to recognize them, the
Indian mind being a strange receptacle for
such stories, and they are apt to sprout new
limbs. Maybe much of their added quaintness
is due to the way in which they were
told by the “fathers.” But in a confidential
way, while you are alone, or when you are
admitted to their camp fire on a winter night,
you will hear the stories of their mythology.
I believe that the greatest mark of friendship,
or confidence, that an Indian can give,
is to tell you his religion. After one has so
talked with me, I should ever trust him; and
I feel on very good terms with these Indians,
since our experience of the other night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[312]</span></p>

<p>A knowledge of the watering places, and
of the trails and passes, is considered of great
importance, and is necessary, to give standing
to a chief.</p>

<p>This evening, the <em>Shi′-vwits</em>, for whom we
have sent, come in, and, after supper, we
hold a long council. A blazing fire is built,
and around this we sit—the Indians living
here, the <em>Shi′-vwits</em>, Jacob Hamblin, and
myself. This man, Hamblin, speaks their
language well, and has a great influence over
all the Indians in the region round about.
He is a silent, reserved man, and when he
speaks, it is in a slow, quiet way, that inspires
great awe. His talk is so low that they must
listen attentively to hear, and they sit around
him in deathlike silence. When he finishes
a measured sentence, the chief repeats it,
and they all give a solemn grunt. But, first,
I fill my pipe, light it, and take a few whiffs,
then pass it to Hamblin; he smokes, and
gives it to the man next, and so it goes
around. When it has passed the chief, he
takes out his own pipe, fills, and lights it, and<span class="pagenum">[313]</span>
passes it around after mine. I can smoke
my own pipe in turn, but, when the Indian
pipe comes around, I am nonplussed. It has
a large stem, which has, at some time, been
broken, and now there is a buckskin rag
wound around it, and tied with sinew, so
that the end of the stem is a huge mouthful,
and looks like the burying ground of old
dead spittle, venerable for a century. To
gain time, I refill it, then engage in very
earnest conversation, and, all unawares, I
pass it to my neighbor unlighted.</p>

<p>I tell the Indians that I wish to spend
some months in their country during the coming
year, and that I would like them to treat
me as a friend. I do not wish to trade; do
not want their lands. Heretofore I have
found it very difficult to make the natives
understand my object, but the gravity of
the Mormon missionary helps me much. I
tell them that all the great and good
white men are anxious to know very many
things; that they spend much time in learning,
and that the greatest man is he who<span class="pagenum">[314]</span>
knows the most. They want to know all
about the mountains and the valleys, the
rivers and the cañons, the beasts, and birds,
and snakes. Then I tell them of many Indian
tribes, and where they live; of the European
nations; of the Chinese, of Africans,
and all the strange things about them that
come to my mind. I tell them of the ocean,
of great rivers and high mountains, of
strange beasts and birds. At last I tell them
I wish to learn about their cañons and mountains,
and about themselves, to tell other men
at home; and that I want to take pictures of
everything, and show them to my friends.
All this occupied much time, and the matter
and manner made a deep impression.</p>

<p>Then their chief replies: “Your talk is
good, and we believe what you say. We believe
in Jacob, and look upon you as a
father. When you are hungry, you may
have our game. You may gather our sweet
fruits. We will give you food when you
come to our land. We will show you the
springs, and you may drink; the water is<span class="pagenum">[315]</span>
good. We will be friends, and when you
come we will be glad. We will tell the Indians
who live on the other side of the great
river that we have seen <em>Ka′-pu-rats</em>, and he is
the Indians’ friend. We will tell them he is
Jacob’s friend. We are very poor. Look
at our women and children; they are naked.
We have no horses; we climb the rocks, and
our feet are sore. We live among rocks, and
they yield little food and many thorns.
When the cold moons come, our children are
hungry. We have not much to give; you
must not think us mean. You are wise; we
have heard you tell strange things. We are
ignorant. <a id="Ref_19" href="#BRef_19">Last year we killed three white
men</a>. Bad men said they were our enemies.
They told great lies. We thought them
true. We were mad; it made us big fools.
We are very sorry. Do not think of them,
it is done; let us be friends. We are ignorant—like
little children in understanding
compared with you. When we do wrong,
do not get mad, and be like children too.</p>

<p>“When white men kill our people, we kill<span class="pagenum">[316]</span>
them. Then they kill more of us. It is not
good. We hear that the white men are a
great number. When they stop killing us,
there will be no Indian left to bury the dead.
We love our country; we know not other
lands. We hear that other lands are better;
we do not know. The pines sing, and we
are glad. Our children play in the warm
sand; we hear them sing, and are glad. The
seeds ripen, and we have to eat, and we are
glad. We do not want their good lands;
we want our rocks, and the great mountains
where our fathers lived. We are very poor;
we are very ignorant; but we are very honest.
You have horses, and many things. You are
very wise; you have a good heart. We will
be friends. Nothing more have I to say.”</p>

<p><em>Ka′-pu-rats</em> is the name by which I am
known among the Utes and Shoshones,
meaning “arm off.” There was much more
repetition than I have given, and much emphasis.
After this a few presents were
given, we shook hands, and the council broke
up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[317]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Hamblin fell into conversation with
one of the men, and held him until the others
had left, and then learned more of the particulars
of the death of the three men. They
came upon the Indian village almost starved
and exhausted with fatigue. They were
supplied with food, and put on their way to
the settlements. Shortly after they had left,
an Indian from the east of the Colorado
arrived at their village, and told them about
a number of miners having killed a squaw
in drunken brawl, and no doubt these were
the men. No person had ever come down
the cañon; that was impossible; they were
trying to hide their guilt. In this way he
worked them into a great rage. They followed,
surrounded the men in ambush, and
filled them full of arrows.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>That night I slept in peace, although these
murderers of my men, and their friends, the
<em>U-in-ka-rets</em>, were sleeping not five hundred
yards away. While we were gone to the<span class="pagenum">[318]</span>
cañon, the pack-train and supplies, enough
to make an Indian rich beyond his wildest
dreams, were all left in their charge, and were
all safe; not even a lump of sugar was pilfered
by the children.</p>

<p><em>September 20.</em>—For several days we have
been discussing the relative merits of several
names for these mountains. The Indians
call them <em>U-in-ka-rets</em>, the region of pines,
and we adopt the name. The great mountain
we call Mount Trumbull, in honor of
the Senator. To-day the train starts back
to the cañon water-pocket, while Captain
Bishop and I climb Mount Trumbull. On
our way we pass the point that was the last
opening to the volcano.</p>

<p>It seems but a few years since the last
flood of fire swept the valley. Between two
rough, conical hills it poured, and ran down
the valley to the foot of a mountain standing
almost at the lower end, then parted, and
ran on either side of the mountain. This
last overflow is very plainly marked; there
is soil, with trees and grass, to the very edge<span class="pagenum">[319]</span>
of it, on a more ancient bed. The flood was
everywhere on its border from ten to twenty
feet in height, terminating abruptly, and
looking like a wall from below. On cooling,
it shattered into fragments, but these are
still in place, and you can see the outlines
of streams and waves. So little time has
elapsed since it ran down, that the elements
have not weathered a soil, and there is
scarcely any vegetation on it, but here and
there a lichen is found. And yet, so long
ago was it poured from the depths, that
where ashes and cinders have collected in a
few places, some huge cedars have grown.
Near the crater the frozen waves of black
basalt are rent with deep fissures, transverse
to the direction of the flow. Then we ride
through a cedar forest, up a long ascent, until
we come to cliffs of columnar basalt. Here
we tie our horses, and prepare for a climb
among the columns. Through crevices we
work, till at last we are on the mountain, a
thousand acres of pine land spread out before
us, gently rising to the other edge.<span class="pagenum">[320]</span>
There are two peaks on the mountain. We
walked two miles to the foot of the one looking
to be the highest, then a long, hard climb
to its summit. And here, oh, what a view
is before us! A vision of glory! Peaks of
lava all around below us. The Vermilion
Cliffs to the north, with their splendor of
colors; the Pine Valley Mountain to the
northwest, clothed in mellow, perspective
haze; unnamed mountains to the southwest,
towering over cañons, bottomless to my peering
gaze, like chasms to the nadir hell; and
away beyond, the San Francisco Mountains,
lifting their black heads into the heavens.
We find our way down the mountain, reaching
the trail made by the pack-train just at
dusk.</p>

<p>Two days more, and we are at Pipe
Spring; one day, and we are at Kanab.
Eight miles above the town is a cañon, on
either side of which is a group of lakes. By
the side of one of these I sit, the crystal waters
at my feet, at which I may drink at will.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Edited by Horace Kephart</em></p>

<p>¶ Here are brought together for the first time the great stories of
adventure of all ages and countries. These are the personal records
of the men who climbed the mountains and penetrated the jungles;
who explored the seas and crossed the deserts; who knew the
chances and took them, and lived to write their own tales of hardship
and endurance and achievement. The series will consist of
an indeterminate number of volumes—for the stories are myriad.
The whole will be edited by Horace Kephart. Each volume
answers the test of these two questions: Is it true? Is it interesting?</p>

<p>¶ The entire series is uniform in style and binding. Among the
titles now ready or in preparation are those described on the following
pages.</p>

<p><span class="largefont">1. IN THE OLD WEST, by George Frederick
Ruxton.</span> The men who blazed the trail across the Rockies to the
Pacific were the independent trappers and hunters in the days
before the Mexican war. They left no records of their adventures
and most of them linger now only as shadowy names. But a young
Englishman lived among them for a time, saw life from their point
of view, trapped with them and fought with them against the
Indians. That was George Frederick Ruxton. His story is our
only complete picture of the Old West in the days of the real
Pioneers, of Kit Carson, Jim Bridger, Bill Williams, the Sublettes,
and all the rest of that glorious company of the forgotten who
opened the West.</p>

<p><span class="largefont">2. CASTAWAYS AND CRUSOES.</span> Since the beginnings
of navigation men have faced the dangers of shipwreck
and starvation. Scattered through the annals of the sea are the
stories of those to whom disaster came and the personal records of
the way they met it. Some of them are given in this volume, narratives
of men who lived by their hands among savages and on forlorn
coasts, or drifted helpless in open boats. They range from the
South Seas to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, from the iron coast of Patagonia
to the shores of Cuba. They are echoes from the days when
the best that could be hoped by the man who went to sea was hardship
and man’s-sized work.</p>

<p><span class="largefont">3. CAPTIVES AMONG THE INDIANS.</span> First of all
is the story of Captain James Smith, who was captured by the Delawares
at the time of Braddock’s defeat, was adopted into the tribe,
and for four years lived as an Indian, hunting with them, studying
their habits, and learning their point of view. Then there is the
story of Father Bressani who felt the tortures of the Iroquois, of
Mary Rowlandson who was among the human spoils of King
Philip’s war, and of Mercy Harbison who suffered in the red flood
that followed St. Clair’s defeat. All are personal records made by
the actors themselves in those days when the Indian was constantly
at our forefathers’s doors.</p>

<p><span class="largefont">4. FIRST THROUGH THE GRAND CANYON, by
Major John Wesley Powell.</span> Major Powell was an officer in the
Union Army who lost an arm at Shiloh. In spite of this four years
after the war he organized an expedition which explored the Grand
Canyon of the Colorado in boats—the first to make this journey. His
story has been lost for years in the oblivion of a scientific report.
It is here rescued and presented as a record of one of the great
personal exploring feats, fitted to rank with the exploits of Pike,
Lewis and Clark, and Mackenzie.</p>

<p><span class="largefont">5. ADRIFT IN THE ARCTIC ICE-PACK, By
Elisha Kent Kane, M. D.</span> Out of the many expeditions that
went north in search of Sir John Franklin over fifty years ago, it fell
to the lot of one, financed by a New York merchant, to spend an
Arctic winter drifting aimlessly in the grip of the Polar ice in Lancaster
Sound. The surgeon of the expedition kept a careful diary
and out of that record told the first complete story of a Far Northern
winter. That story is here presented, shorn of the purely scientific
data and stripped to the personal exploits and adventures of the
author and the other members of the crew.</p>
